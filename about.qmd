The [**Agence Nationale de la Recherche**](https://anr.fr/) (ANR) is a French institution founded in February 2005.
It is tasked with funding the French scientific research activities, both public and partners-based.
:::

:::

It does so through a competitive call for project every year. Accepted projects are typically funded for a duration of three to four years. In 2021, 23% of the submitted projects were funded in the end, for a total budget of nearly 900 M€.
The project **CONMAN**, accepted during the 2022 call for project, is funded through the particular program [*Jeunes Chercheuses et Jeunes Chercheur*](https://anr.fr/en/call-for-proposals-details/call/programme-jeunes-chercheuses-et-jeunes-chercheurs-jcjc/).

## Arts et Métiers Institute of Technology

**Arts et Métiers** has eight different campuses throughout France, fifteen research laboratories and three institutes recognized in the fields of mechanics and industrialization.
It develops teaching and research activities in three main fields: (i) mechanics, materials and processes, (ii) fluids and energy systems, and (iii) design, industrialization, risk management and decision-making.
The school's training programs include about 24 research-based masters, 20 advanced masters programs and Ph. D. studies.

Along with researchers from **Arts et Métiers Institute of Technology**, **DynFluid** also hosts two colleagues from the [**Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers**](https://www.cnam.fr/) (CNAM).
Members of **DynFluid** have a worlwide recognized expertise in high-performance computing for compressible turbulent flows, the development of uncertainty quantification techniques for industrial turbulence models, as well as for their studies of the hydrodynamic instabilities and physical mechanisms underpinning the transition to turbulence.
