	abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular technique for modal decomposition, ﬂow analysis, and reduced-order modeling. In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system’s description online as time evolves. This work provides an eﬃcient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system’s dynamics as new data becomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data, and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of “windowed DMD”, in which only the most recent data are used. The eﬃciency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about 200, the proposed algorithm is the most eﬃcient for realtime computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more eﬃcient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that the method is eﬀective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the ﬂow over a ﬂat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.},

              Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied effectively in games and robotic manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in experimental fluid mechanics by applying it to reduce the drag of circular cylinders in turbulent flow, a canonical fluid–structure interaction problem. Although physics agnostic, RL managed to reduce the drag by

Following this discovery, we used high-fidelity simulations to probe the underlying physical mechanisms so that the discovered control techniques can be generalized to other similar flow problems. More broadly, RL-guided active control can lead to efficient exploration of additional flow-control strategies in experimental fluid mechanics, potentially paving the way for accelerating scientific discovery and different designs in flow-related engineering problems.

            We have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) in bluff body flow control problems both in experiments and simulations by automatically discovering active control strategies for drag reduction in turbulent flow. Specifically, we aimed to maximize the power gain efficiency by properly selecting the rotational speed of two small cylinders, located parallel to and downstream of the main cylinder. By properly defining rewards and designing noise reduction techniques, and after an automatic sequence of tens of towing experiments, the RL agent was shown to discover a control strategy that is comparable to the optimal strategy found through lengthy systematically planned control experiments. Subsequently, these results were verified by simulations that enabled us to gain insight into the physical mechanisms of the drag reduction process. While RL has been used effectively previously in idealized computer flow simulation studies, this study demonstrates its effectiveness in experimental fluid mechanics and verifies it by simulations, potentially paving the way for efficient exploration of additional active flow control strategies in other complex fluid mechanics applications.},

We analyze full-order, optimal controllers for large dynamical systems in the presence of multiple actuators and sensors. The full-order controllers do not require any preliminary model reduction or low-order approximation: this feature allows us to assess the optimal performance of an actuated ﬂow without relying on any estimation process or further hypothesis on the disturbances. We start from the original technique proposed by Bewley et al. (Meccanica 51(12):2997–3014, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11012-016-0547-3), the adjoint of the direct-adjoint (ADA) algorithm. The algorithm is iterative and allows bypassing the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation associated with the optimal control problem, typically infeasible for large systems. In this numerical work, we extend the ADA iteration into a more general framework that includes the design of controllers with multiple, coupled inputs and robust controllers (H∞ methods). First, we demonstrate our results by showing the analytical equivalence between the full Riccati solutions and the ADA approximations in the multiple inputs case. In the second part of the article, we analyze the performance of the algorithm in terms of convergence of the solution, by comparing it with analogous techniques. We ﬁnd an excellent scalability with the number of inputs (actuators), making the method a viable way for full-order control design in complex settings. Finally, the applicability of the algorithm to ﬂuid mechanics problems is shown using the linearized Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation and the Kármán vortex street past a two-dimensional cylinder.},

The idea is to derive a small matrix from the highdimensional data, which is then used to eﬃciently compute the dynamic modes and eigenvalues. The algorithm is presented in a modular probabilistic framework, and the approximation quality can be controlled via oversampling and power iterations. The eﬀectiveness of the resulting randomized DMD algorithm is demonstrated on several benchmark examples of increasing complexity, providing an accurate and eﬃcient approach to extract spatiotemporal coherent structures from big data in a framework that scales with the intrinsic rank of the data, rather than the ambient measurement dimension.

	abstract = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is the prevailing method for basis generation in the model reduction of fluids. A serious limitation of this method, however, is that it is empirical. In other words, this basis accurately represents the flow data used to generate it, but may not be accurate when applied ‘off-design’. Thus, the reduced-order model may lose accuracy for flow parameters (e.g. Reynolds number, initial or boundary conditions and forcing parameters) different from those used to generate the POD basis and generally does. This paper investigates the use of sensitivity analysis in the basis selection step to partially address this limitation. We examine two strategies that use the sensitivity of the POD modes with respect to the problem parameters. Numerical experiments performed on the flow past a square cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies. The newly derived bases allow for a more accurate representation of the flows when exploring the parameter space. Expanding the POD basis built at one state with its sensitivity leads to low-dimensional dynamical systems having attractors that approximate fairly well the attractor of the full-order Navier–Stokes equations for large parameter changes.},

These horizontal and vertical perturbations are added at different phase values over a period, in order to develop a linear one-dimensional model with respect to the limit cycle that describes the high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics of the ﬂuid ﬂow via only a single scalar phase variable. This model is then utilized to acquire the theoretical conditions for the synchronization between the cylinder wake and the harmonic forcings added in the global near-wake region. Valuable insights are gained by comparing the ﬁndings of the present research against those rendered by the dynamic mode decomposition and adjoint analysis of the wake dynamics in earlier works. The present analysis reveals regions in the ﬂow which enable phase synchronization or desynchronization to periodic excitations for applications such as active ﬂow control and ﬂuid-structure interactions.},

For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efﬁcient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers’ equation, Darcy ﬂow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the ﬁrst ML-based method to successfully model turbulent ﬂows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under ﬁxed resolution.},

	abstract = {The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)—a popular method for performing data-driven Koopman spectral analysis—has gained increased popularity for extracting dynamically meaningful spatiotemporal descriptions of ﬂuid ﬂows from snapshot measurements. Often times, DMD descriptions can be used for predictive purposes as well, which enables informed decision-making based on DMD model forecasts. Despite its widespread use and utility, DMD can fail to yield accurate dynamical descriptions when the measured snapshot data are imprecise due to, e.g., sensor noise. Here, we express DMD as a two-stage algorithm in order to isolate a source of systematic error. We show that DMD’s ﬁrst stage, a subspace projection step, systematically introduces bias errors by processing snapshots asymmetrically. To remove this systematic error, we propose utilizing an augmented snapshot matrix in a subspace projection step, as in problems of total leastsquares, in order to account for the error present in all snapshots. The resulting unbiased and noise-aware total DMD (TDMD) formulation reduces to standard DMD in the absence of snapshot errors, while the two-stage perspective generalizes the de-biasing framework to other related methods as well. TDMD’s performance is demonstrated in numerical and experimental ﬂuids examples. In particular, in the analysis of time-resolved particle image velocimetry data for a separated ﬂow, TDMD outperforms standard DMD by providing dynamical interpretations that are consistent with alternative analysis techniques. Further, TDMD extracts modes that reveal detailed spatial structures missed by standard DMD.},

	abstract = {A method to ﬁnd optimal 2nd-order perturbations is presented, and applied to ﬁnd the optimal spanwise-wavy surface for suppression of cylinder wake instability. Second-order perturbations are required to capture the stabilizing eﬀect of spanwise waviness, which is ignored by standard adjoint-based sensitivity analyses. Here, previous methods are extended so that (i) 2nd-order sensitivity is formulated for base ﬂow changes satisfying linearised Navier-Stokes, and (ii) the resulting method is applicable to a 2D global instability problem. This makes it possible to formulate 2nd-order sensitivity to shape modiﬁcations. Using this formulation, we ﬁnd the optimal shape to suppress the a cylinder wake instability. The optimal shape is then perturbed by random distributions in full 3D stability analysis to conﬁrm that it is a local optimal at the given amplitude and wavelength. Furthermore, it is shown that none of the 10 random wavy shapes alone stabilize the wake ﬂow at Re = 50, while the optimal shape does. At Re = 100, surface waviness of maximum height 1\% of the cylinder diameter is suﬃcient to stabilize the ﬂow. The optimal surface creates streaks by passively extracting energy from the base ﬂow derivatives and eﬀectively altering the tangential velocity component at the wall, as opposed to spanwise-wavy suction which inputs energy to the normal velocity component at the wall. This paper presents a fully two-dimensional and computationally aﬀordable method to ﬁnd optimal 2nd-order perturbations of generic ﬂow instability problems and any boundary control (such as boundary forcing, shape modulation or suction).},

This framework can be decomposed into four building blocks. First, the sensor signals are lifted to a dynamic feature space without false neighbours. Second, we identify a sparse human-interpretable nonlinear dynamical system for the feature state based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Third, if PIV snapshots are available, a local linear mapping from the feature state to the velocity field is performed to reconstruct the full state of the system. Fourth, a generalized feature-based modal decomposition identifies coherent structures that are most dynamically correlated with the linear and nonlinear interaction terms in the sparse model, adding interpretability. Steps 1 and 2 define a black-box model. Optional steps 3 and 4 lift the black-box dynamics to a grey-box model in terms of the identified coherent structures, if non-time-resolved full-state data are available. This grey-box modelling strategy is successfully applied to the transient and post-transient laminar cylinder wake, and compares favourably with a proper orthogonal decomposition model. We foresee numerous applications of this highly flexible modelling strategy, including estimation, prediction and control. Moreover, the feature space may be based on intrinsic coordinates, which are unaffected by a key challenge of modal expansion: the slow change of low-dimensional coherent structures with changing geometry and varying parameters.},

The extension, labeled as higher order dynamic mode decomposition, uses time-lagged snapshots and can be seen as superimposed DMD in a sliding window. The new method is illustrated and clariﬁed using some toy model dynamics, the Stuart–Landau equation, and the Lorenz system. In addition, the new method is applied to (and its robustness is tested in) some permanent and transient dynamics resulting from the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (a paradigm of pattern forming systems), for which standard DMD is seen to only uncover trivial dynamics, and the thermal convection in a rotating spherical shell subject to a radial gravity ﬁeld.},

In the last few years, it has spread in the field of computational mechanics, and particularly in fluid dynamics, with recent applications in flow control and shape optimization. In this work, we conduct a detailed review of existing DRL applications to fluid mechanics problems. In addition, we present recent results that further illustrate the potential of DRL in Fluid Mechanics. The coupling methods used in each case are covered, detailing their advantages and limitations. Our review also focuses on the comparison with classical methods for optimal control and optimization. Finally, several test cases are described that illustrate recent progress made in this field. The goal of this publication is to provide an understanding of DRL capabilities along with state-of-the-art applications in fluid dynamics to researchers wishing to address new problems with these methods.},

This approach approximates the Koopman operator using a set of scalar observables, which are functions that map states to scalars, that is determined implicitly by the choice of a kernel function. This circumvents the computational issues that arise due to the number of basis functions required to span a “suﬃciently rich” subspace of the space of scalar observables in such applications. We illustrate this method on two examples: the FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE, a prototypical one-dimensional reaction-diﬀusion system, and vorticity data obtained from experimentally obtained velocity data for ﬂow over a cylinder at Reynolds number 413. In both examples, we compare our results with related methods, such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) that have the same cost as our approach.},

The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework.

The ability to manipulate this vortex shedding is critical to improving the aerodynamic performance of bodies in a ﬂow. This goal requires a precise understanding of how the perturbations affect the asymptotic behaviour of the oscillatory ﬂow and of the ability to control transient dynamics. In this work, we develop an energy-efﬁcient ﬂow-control strategy to alter the oscillation phase of time-periodic ﬂuid ﬂows rapidly. First, we perform a phase-sensitivity analysis to construct a reduced-order model for the response of the ﬂow oscillation to impulsive control inputs at various phases. Next, we introduce a real-time optimal phase-control strategy based on the phase-sensitivity function obtained by solving the associated Euler–Lagrange equations as a two-point boundary-value problem. Our approach is demonstrated for the incompressible laminar ﬂow past a circular cylinder and an airfoil. We show the effectiveness of phase control with different actuation inputs, including blowing and rotary control. Moreover, our control approach is a sensor-based approach without the need for access to high-dimensional measurements of the entire ﬂow ﬁeld.},

	title = {Model reduction of dynamical systems on nonlinear manifolds using deep convolutional autoencoders},
	abstract = {Nearly all model-reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. Such subspaces are typically computed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the reduced-basis method, and (balanced) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Unfortunately, restricting the state to evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs can be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if the problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., diﬀusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit a slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To address this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems onto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the time-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin projection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) projection. We perform analyses that provide insight into the relationship between these proposed approaches and classical linear-subspace reduced-order models; we also derive a posteriori discrete-time error bounds for the proposed approaches. In addition, we propose a computationally practical approach for computing the nonlinear manifold, which is based on convolutional autoencoders from deep learning. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the method to signiﬁcantly outperform even the optimal linear-subspace ROM on benchmark advection-dominated problems, thereby demonstrating the method’s ability to overcome the intrinsic n-width limitations of linear subspaces.},

Taking as guidelines the derivation of the Lorenz system, the chaotic thermal convection dynamics simulated using a high-ﬁdelity computational ﬂuid dynamics solver are ﬁrst embedded into a low-dimensional space using dynamic mode decomposition. After having reviewed the physical properties the reduced-order model should exhibit, the latter is identiﬁed using SINDy, an increasingly popular and ﬂexible framework for the identiﬁcation of nonlinear continuous-time dynamical systems from data. The identiﬁed model closely resembles the canonical Lorenz system, having the same structure and exhibiting the same physical properties.

In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the eﬀects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations—only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations.

These equations have been shown to reproduce the key physics of transonic aerofoil flows. Results from global-stability analysis are shown to be in good agreement with experiments and numerical simulations. The stability boundary, as a function of the Mach number and angle of attack, consists of an upper and a lower branch – the lower branch shows features consistent with a supercritical bifurcation. The unstable modes provide insight into the basic character of buffeting flow at near-critical conditions and are consistent with fully nonlinear simulations.

The learning environment supports four flow configurations with Reynolds numbers 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. A new smoothing interpolation function is proposed to help the PPO algorithm learn to set continuous actions, which is of great importance to effectively suppress problematic jumps in lift and allow a better convergence for the training process. It is shown that the DRL controller is able to significantly reduce the lift and drag fluctuations and actively reduce the drag by ∼5.7\%, 21.6\%, 32.7\%, and 38.7\%, at Re = 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. More importantly, it can also effectively reduce drag for any previously unseen value of the Reynolds number between 60 and 400.

Such parametric instabilities are mathematically characterized by their universal un-foldings, or normal form dynamics, whereby a parsimonious model can be used to represent the dynamics. Although center manifold theory guarantees the existence of such low-dimensional normal forms, finding them has remained a long standing challenge. In this work, we introduce deep learning autoencoders to discover coordinate transformations that capture the underlying parametric dependence of a dynamical system in terms of its canonical normal form, allowing for a simple representation of the parametric dependence and bifurcation structure. The autoencoder constrains the latent variable to adhere to a given normal form, thus allowing it to learn the appropriate coordinate transformation. We demonstrate the method on a number of example problems, showing that it can capture a diverse set of normal forms associated with Hopf, pitchfork, transcritical and/or saddle node bifurcations. This method shows how normal forms can be leveraged as canonical and universal building blocks in deep learning approaches for model discovery and reduced-order modeling.},

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-speciﬁc adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been reﬁned by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from selfplay. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the integration of the recently developed dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with a multi-resolution analysis allows for a decomposition method capable of robustly separating complex systems into a hierarchy of multi-resolution time-scale components. A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coeﬃcients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Nin˜o mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at diﬀerent rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an eﬀective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

A linear stability analysis is employed to identify the critical Reynolds number associated with symmetry breaking, and the associated eigenmodes, known as global modes. The analysis shows that the axisymmetric stable base flow breaks the rotational symmetry through a pitchfork \$m=1\$ bifurcation, in agreement with previously reported results for axisymmetric wakes. Above this threshold, the stable base flow is steady and three-dimensional with planar symmetry. A three-dimensional global stability analysis around the steady reflectionally symmetric base flow, assuming no homogeneous directions, predicts accurately the Hopf bifurcation threshold, which leads to asymmetric vortex shedding. DNS simulations validate the stability results and characterize the flow topology during the early chaotic regime.},

	abstract = {A major goal for reduced-order models of unsteady fluid flows is to uncover and exploit latent low-dimensional structure. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provides an energy-optimal linear basis to represent the flow kinematics, but converges slowly for advection-dominated flows and tends to overestimate the number of dynamically relevant variables. We show that nonlinear correlations in the temporal POD coefficients can be exploited to identify the underlying attractor, characterized by a minimal set of driving modes and a manifold equation for the remaining modes. By viewing these nonlinear correlations as an invariant manifold reduction, this least-order representation can be used to stabilize POD-Galerkin models or as a state space for data-driven model identification. In the latter case, we use sparse polynomial regression to learn a compact, interpretable dynamical system model from the time series of the active modal coefficients. We demonstrate this perspective on a quasiperiodic shear-driven cavity flow and show that the dynamics evolve on a torus generated by two independent Stuart-Landau oscillators. These results emphasize the importance of nonlinear dimensionality reduction to reveal underlying structure in complex flows.},

CA techniques are appealing because many can be formulated as eigen-problems, offering great potential for learning linear and nonlinear representations of data in closed-form. However, the eigen-formulation often conceals important analytic and computational drawbacks of CA techniques, such as solving generalized eigen-problems with rank deficient matrices (e.g., small sample size problem), lacking intuitive interpretation of normalization factors, and understanding commonalities and differences between CA methods. This paper proposes a unified least-squares framework to formulate many CA methods. We show how PCA, LDA, CCA, LPP, SC, and its kernel and regularized extensions correspond to a particular instance of least-squares weighted kernel reduced rank regression (LS-WKRRR). The LS-WKRRR formulation of CA methods has several benefits: 1) provides a clean connection between many CA techniques and an intuitive framework to understand normalization factors; 2) yields efficient numerical schemes to solve CA techniques; 3) overcomes the small sample size problem; 4) provides a framework to easily extend CA methods. We derive weighted generalizations of PCA, LDA, SC, and CCA, and several new CA techniques.},

However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we deﬁne DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational eﬃciency and mitigate the eﬀects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deﬁcient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identiﬁcation method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

              , these combined optimal perturbations appear similar to transient growth-only optimal perturbations, and achieve a more efficient overall stabilisation than optimal spanwise-periodic and spanwise-invariant modifications computed for stabilisation only.

However, even when the microscopic governing equations and qualitative macroscopic behaviour are known, it is often difficult to derive a stochastic model that is consistent with observations. This is especially true for systems such as turbulence where the perturbations do not behave like Gaussian white noise, introducing non-Markovian behaviour to the dynamics. We address these challenges with a framework for identifying interpretable stochastic nonlinear dynamics from experimental data, using forward and adjoint Fokker–Planck equations to enforce statistical consistency. If the form of the Langevin equation is unknown, a simple sparsifying procedure can provide an appropriate functional form. We demonstrate that this method can learn stochastic models in two artificial examples: recovering a nonlinear Langevin equation forced by coloured noise and approximating the second-order dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential with the corresponding first-order bifurcation normal form. Finally, we apply Langevin regression to experimental measurements of a turbulent bluff body wake and show that the statistical behaviour of the centre of pressure can be described by the dynamics of the corresponding laminar flow driven by nonlinear state-dependent noise.},

	abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provides a regression framework for adaptively learning a best-ﬁt linear dynamics model over snapshots of temporal, or spatio-temporal, data. A diversity of regression techniques have been developed for producing the linear model approximation whose solutions are exponentials in time. For spatio-temporal data, DMD provides low-rank and interpretable models in the form of dominant modal structures along with their exponential/oscillatory behavior in time. The majority of DMD algorithms, however, are prone to bias errors from noisy measurements of the dynamics, leading to poor model ﬁts and unstable forecasting capabilities. The optimized DMD algorithm minimizes the model bias with a variable projection optimization, thus leading to stabilized forecasting capabilities. Here, the optimized DMD algorithm is improved by using statistical bagging methods whereby a single set of snapshots is used to produce an ensemble of optimized DMD models. The outputs of these models are averaged to produce a bagging, optimized dynamic mode decomposition (BOP-DMD). BOP-DMD not only improves performance, it also robustiﬁes the model and provides both spatial and temporal uncertainty quantiﬁcation (UQ). Thus unlike currently available DMD algorithms, BOP-DMD provides a stable and robust model for probabilistic, or Bayesian forecasting with comprehensive UQ metrics.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a new framework for obtaining a nonintrusive (i.e., not requiring projecting of the governing equations onto the reduced basis modes) reduced order model for two-dimensional fluid problems. To overcome the shortcomings of intrusive model order reduction usually derived by combining the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and the Galerkin projection methods, we developed a novel technique on the basis of randomized dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) as a fast and accurate option in model order reduction. Our approach utilizes an adaptive randomized DMD to obtain a reduced basis in the offline stage, and then the temporal values of the reduced order model are obtained in the online stage through an interpolation using radial basis functions. The rank of the reduced DMD model is given as the unique solution of a constrained optimization problem. The Saint-Venant (shallow water) equations in a channel on the rotating earth are employed to provide the numerical data. We emphasize the excellent behavior of the nonintrusive reduced order model by performing a qualitative analysis. In addition, we gain a significantly reduction of CPU time in computation of the reduced order models compared with the classical DMD method. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The objective of the present paper is to enhance the understanding of the physical mechanics behind two-dimensional transonic buffet. The paper is composed of two parts. In the first part, a global stability analysis based on the linearized Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is performed. A recently developed technique, based on the direct and adjoint unstable global modes, is used to compute the local contribution of the flow to the growth rate and angular frequency of the unstable global mode. The results allow us to identify which zones are directly responsible for the existence of the instability. The technique is firstly used for the vortex-shedding cylinder mode, as a validating case. In the second part, in order to confirm the results of the first part, a selective frequency damping method is locally used in some regions of the flow field. This method consists of applying a low-pass filter on selected zones of the computational domain in order to damp the fluctuations. It allows us to identify which zones are necessary for the persistence of the instability. The two different approaches give the same results: the shock foot is identified as the core of the instability; the shock and the boundary layer downstream of the shock are also necessary zones while damping the fluctuations on the lower surface of the airfoil; and outside the boundary layer between the shock and the trailing edge or above the supersonic zone does not suppress the shock oscillation. A discussion on the several physical models, proposed until now for the buffet phenomenon, and a new model are finally offered in the last section.},

In contrast to DMD, with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly identifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD outperforms both POD and DMD in the limit-cycle resolution from the same snapshots. Robustness of these observations is demonstrated for other parameters of the cylinder wake and for a more complex wake behind three rotating cylinders.

	abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate how physical principles – such as symmetries, invariances, and conservation laws – can be integrated into the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD is a widely-used data analysis technique that extracts low-rank modal structures and dynamics from high-dimensional measurements. However, DMD frequently produces models that are sensitive to noise, fail to generalize outside the training data, and violate basic physical laws. Our physics-informed DMD (piDMD) optimization, which may be formulated as a Procrustes problem, restricts the family of admissible models to a matrix manifold that respects the physical structure of the system. We focus on ﬁve fundamental physical principles – conservation, self-adjointness, localization, causality, and shift-invariance – and derive several closed-form solutions and efﬁcient algorithms for the corresponding piDMD optimizations. With fewer degrees of freedom, piDMD models are less prone to overﬁtting, require less training data, and are often less computationally expensive to build than standard DMD models. We demonstrate piDMD on a range of challenging problems in the physical sciences, including energypreserving ﬂuid ﬂow, travelling-wave systems, the Schro¨ dinger equation, solute advectiondiffusion, a system with causal dynamics, and three-dimensional transitional channel ﬂow. In each case, piDMD signiﬁcantly outperforms standard DMD in metrics such as spectral identiﬁcation, state prediction, and estimation of optimal forcings and responses.},

Sensitivity maps for the sensitivity to base ﬂow modiﬁcations and to a steady force are computed to identify regions of the ﬂow ﬁeld where an input could have a stabilising effect. Four test cases are presented: (1) an analytical test case to prove the theory of the discrete framework, (2) a lid-driven cavity at low Reynolds case to show the improved accuracy in the calculation of the eigenvalues when using the complex-step approximation, (3) the 2D ﬂow past a circular cylinder at just below the critical Reynolds number used to validate the methodology, and ﬁnally, (4) the ﬂow past an open cavity presented to give an example of the discrete method applied to a convectively unstable case. The latter three (2–4) of the aforementioned cases were solved with the 2D compressible Navier–Stokes equations using a Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method. Good agreement was obtained for the validation test case, (3), with appropriate results in the literature.

Laminar separation bubbles are observed over the suction side and near the trailing edge, on the pressure side. Vortex shedding occurs aft of the suction side separation bubble, and vortex interaction results in merging or bursting such that coherent structures or turbulent packets are advected towards the trailing edge. This mechanism modulates the amplitude of the incident pressure signal, leading to different levels of noise emission. Despite the intermittent occurrence of laminar–turbulent transition, the noise spectrum depicts a main tone with multiple equidistant secondary tones. To understand the role of ﬂow instabilities on the tones, the linearised Navier–Stokes equations are examined in their operator form through biglobal stability and resolvent analyses, and by time evolution of disturbances using a matrix-free method. These linear global analyses reveal ampliﬁcation of disturbances over the suction side separation bubble. Spanwise-averaged pressure ﬂuctuations elucidate aspects of the acoustic feedback loop mechanism in the nonlinear solutions. This feedback process is self-sustained by acoustic waves radiated from the trailing edge, which reach the most sensitive ﬂow location near the leading edge, as identiﬁed by the resolvent analysis.

            Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.
          , 
            Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

In this work, we introduce a deep learning technique to discover a single low-dimensional model for such data that captures the underlying parametric dependence in terms of a normal form. A normal form is a symbolic expression, or universal unfolding, that describes how a the reduced-order differential equation model varies with respect to a bifurcation parameter. Our approach introduces coupled autoencoders for the state and parameter, with the latent variables constrained to adhere to a given normal form. We demonstrate our method on one-parameter bifurcations that occur in the canonical Lorenz96 equations and a neural ﬁeld equation. This method demonstrates how normal forms can be leveraged as canonical and universal building blocks in deep learning approaches for model discovery and reduced-order modeling.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for computing Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) evolution matrices, which we use to analyze dynamical systems. Unlike the majority of existing methods, our approach is based on a variational formulation consisting of data alignment penalty terms and constitutive orthogonality constraints. Our method does not make any assumptions on the structure of the data or their size, and thus it is applicable to a wide range of problems including non-linear scenarios or extremely small observation sets. In addition, our technique is robust to noise that is independent of the dynamics and it does not require input data to be sequential. Our key idea is to introduce a regularization term for the forward and backward dynamics. The obtained minimization problem is solved eﬃciently using the Alternating Method of Multipliers (ADMM) which requires two Sylvester equation solves per iteration. Our numerical scheme converges empirically and is similar to a provably convergent ADMM scheme. We compare our approach to various state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark dynamical systems.},

              Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable

              , including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and ‘snowflake’ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained ‘droplets’ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

	abstract = {A speciﬁc feature of three-dimensional bluff body wakes, ﬂow bistability, is a subject of particular recent interest. This feature consists of a random ﬂipping of the wake between two asymmetric conﬁgurations and is believed to contribute to the pressure drag of many bluff bodies. In this study we apply the modelling approach recently suggested for axisymmetric bodies by Rigas et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 778, 2015, R2) to the reﬂectional symmetry-breaking modes of a rectilinear bluff body wake. We demonstrate the validity of the model and its Reynolds number independence through time-resolved base pressure measurements of the natural wake. Further, oscillating ﬂaps are used to investigate the dynamics and time scales of the instability associated with the ﬂipping process, demonstrating that they are largely independent of Reynolds number. The modelling approach is then used to design a feedback controller that uses the ﬂaps to suppress the symmetry-breaking modes. The controller is successful, leading to a suppression of the bistability of the wake, with concomitant reductions in both lateral and streamwise forces. Importantly, the controller is found to be efﬁcient, the actuator requiring only 24 \% of the aerodynamic power saving. The controller therefore provides a key demonstration of efﬁcient feedback control used to reduce the drag of a high-Reynolds-number three-dimensional bluff body. Furthermore, the results suggest that suppression of large-scale structures is a fundamentally efﬁcient approach for bluff body drag reduction.},

	abstract = {The effect of freestream turbulence on the dynamics of an incompressible flow past a cylindrical roughness element in subcritical conditions (i.e., for Reynolds numbers below the onset of linear instability) has been investigated by the joint application of direct numerical simulations, linear modal and nonmodal stability analyses, and dynamic mode decomposition. At first, the influence of the Reynolds number and the ratio of the boundary layer's thickness to roughness height on the three-dimensional spatiotemporal (global) stability of the flow has been investigated. Depending on the operating conditions, the leading instability can either be varicose (symmetric) or sinuous (antisymmetric). In both cases, when the flow is excited by broadband frequency forcing, dynamic mode decomposition extracts only varicose coherent structures even though optimal response analysis predicts a strong amplification of sinuous disturbances having frequency close to that of the marginally stable sinuous eigenmode. This apparent discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the sinuous instability is sensitive to a very limited range of frequencies barely excited by freestream turbulence while varicose disturbances are associated with high amplification in a much wider frequency range. Hence, in this case the flow behaves as an amplifier of varicose perturbations rather than a resonator. Consequences on the subsequent transition to turbulence have been studied, highlighting that varicose perturbations extract energy from the near-wake region, get continuously amplified due to the excitation provided by freestream turbulence, and eventually give rise to a shedding of hairpin vortices.},

Given the time series of the lift coefficient at different angles of attack for the OAT15A supercritical profile, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) technique is used to extract a parameterized, interpretable, and minimal-order description of this dynamics. For all the operating conditions considered, SINDy infers that the dynamics in the lift-coefficient time series can be modeled by a simple parameterized Stuart–Landau oscillator, reducing the computation time from hundreds of core hours to seconds. The identified models are then supplemented with equally parameterized low-dimensional dynamic mode decomposition based state observers enabling real-time estimation of the whole flowfield from the predicted lift. The value of this simple model is in the possibility of enriching sparse data sets in the buffet regime for new geometries. Only a few unsteady simulations need to be performed to adjust the coefficients of the identified model and then supplement the data set with new cases. Simplicity, accuracy, and interpretability make the identified model an attractive tool toward the construction of real-time systems to be used during the design, certification, and operational phases of the aircraft life cycle.},

Two successive bifurcations lead to two limit cycles with different frequencies and different numbers of structures which propagate along the top of the cavity and circulate in its interior. A branch of quasi-periodic states produced by secondary Hopf bifurcations transfers the stability from one limit cycle to the other. A full analysis of this scenario is obtained by means of nonlinear simulations, linear stability analysis and Floquet analysis. We characterize the temporal behaviour of the limit cycles and quasi-periodic state via Fourier transforms and their spatial behaviour via the Hilbert transform. We address the relevance of linearization about the mean flow. Although here the nonlinear frequencies are not very far from those obtained by linearization about the base flow, the difference is substantially reduced when eigenvalues are obtained instead from linearization about the mean and in addition, the corresponding growth rate is small, a combination of properties called RZIF (real zero imaginary frequency). Moreover growth rates obtained by linearization about the mean of one limit cycle are correlated with relative stability to the other limit cycle. Finally, we show that the frequencies of the successive modes are separated by a constant increment.},

	abstract = {We present modal and non-modal linear stability analyses of Poiseuille flow through a plane channel with a porous substrate modeled using the Volume Averaged Navier–Stokes (VANS) equations. Modal stability analysis shows the destabilization of the flow with increasing porosity of the layer. The instability mode originates from the homogeneous fluid region of the channel for all the values of porosity considered but the governing mechanism changes. Perturbation kinetic energy analysis reveals the importance of viscous dissipation at low porosity values while dissipation in the porous substrate becomes significant at higher porosity. Scaling analysis highlights the invariance of the critical wavenumber with changing porosity. On the other hand, the critical Reynolds number remains invariant at low porosity and scales as Rec∼(H∕δ)1.4 at high porosity where δ is the typical thickness of the vorticity layer at the fluid–porous interface. This reveals the existence of a Tollmien–Schlichting-like viscous instability mechanism at low porosity values, and Rayleigh analysis shows the presence of an inviscid instability mechanism at high porosity. For the whole range of porosities considered, the non-modal analysis shows that the optimal mechanism responsible for transient energy amplification is the lift-up effect, giving rise to streaky structure as in single-phase plane Poiseuille flow. The present results strongly suggest that the transition to turbulence follows the same path as that of classical Poiseuille flow at low porosity values, while it is dictated by the modal instability for high porosity values.},

Further increasing the Reynolds number eventually triggers self-sustained periodic oscillations of the flow in the vicinity of the spanwise end walls of the cavity. This secondary instability causes the emergence of a new set of Taylor–Görtler vortices experiencing a spanwise drift directed toward the spanwise end walls of the cavity. While a two-dimensional stability analysis would fail to capture this secondary instability due to the neglect of the lateral walls, it is the first time to our knowledge that this drifting of the vortices can be entirely characterized by a three-dimensional linear stability analysis of the flow.

The four novel ingredients proposed here are, firstly, an interface-correction level set (ICLS) method; global mass conservation is achieved by performing an additional advection near the interface, with a correction velocity obtained by locally solving an algebraic equation, which is easy to implement in both 2D and 3D. Secondly, we report a second-order accurate geometric estimation of the curvature at the interface and, thirdly, the combination of the ghost fluid method with the fast pressure-correction approach enabling an accurate and fast computation even for large density contrasts.

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevFluids.2.033903},
	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that intermediate magnitude of surface tension has a counterintuitive destabilizing effect on two-phase planar jets. In the present study, the transition process in confined two-dimensional jets of two fluids with varying viscosity ratio is investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNSs). The outer fluid coflow velocity is 17\% of that of the central jet. Neutral curves for the appearance of persistent oscillations are found by recording the norm of the velocity residuals in DNS for over 1000 nondimensional time units or until the signal has reached a constant level in a logarithmic scale, either a converged steady state or a “statistically steady” oscillatory state. Oscillatory final states are found for all viscosity ratios ranging from 10−1 to 10. For uniform viscosity (m=1), the first bifurcation is through a surface-tension-driven global instability. On the other hand, for low viscosity of the outer fluid, there is a mode competition between a steady asymmetric Coanda-type attachment mode and the surface-tension-induced mode. At moderate surface tension, the first bifurcation is through the Coanda-type attachment, which eventually triggers time-dependent convective bursts. At high surface tension, the first bifurcation is through the surface-tension-dominated mode. For high viscosity of the outer fluid, persistent oscillations appear due to a strong convective instability, although it is shown that absolute instability may be possible at even higher viscosity ratios. Finally, we show that the jet is still convectively and absolutely unstable far from the inlet when the shear profile is nearly constant. Comparing this situation to a parallel Couette flow (without inflection points), we show that in both flows, a hidden interfacial mode brought out by surface tension becomes temporally and absolutely unstable in an intermediate Weber and Reynolds regime. By an energy analysis of the Couette flow case, we show that surface tension, although dissipative, can induce a velocity field near the interface that extracts energy from the flow through a viscous mechanism. This study highlights the rich dynamics of immiscible planar uniform-density jets, where different self-sustained and convective mechanisms compete and the nature of the instability depends on the exact parameter values.},

The membrane of the cell and of its nucleus are modelled as a thin elastic material obeying a Neo-Hookean constitutive law. The fluid–structure coupling is obtained using an immersed boundary method. The variations induced by the presence of the nucleus on the cell deformation are investigated when varying the viscosity ratio between the inner and outer fluids, the membrane elasticity and its bending stiffness. The deformation of the eukaryotic cell is smaller than that of the prokaryotic one. The reduction in deformation increases for larger values of the capillary number. The eukaryotic cell remains thicker in its middle part compared to the prokaryotic one, thus making it less flexible to pass through narrow capillaries. For a viscosity ratio of 5, the deformation of the cell is smaller than in the case of uniform viscosity. In addition, for non-zero bending stiffness of the membrane, the deformation decreases and the shape is closer to an ellipsoid. Finally, we compare the results obtained modelling the nucleus as an inner stiffer membrane with those obtained using a rigid particle.},

Several laminar cases are first studied from Re=2000 to Re=10000, and a gradual increase of the Reynolds number is then performed in order to investigate one transitional case at Re=20000. Computations are compared with measurements where the instability mechanisms in the separated zone and near wake zone have been analyzed. The mechanism of transition is investigated, where the DMD (Dynamic Mode Decomposition) is used in order to extract the main physical modes of the flow and to highlight the interaction between the transition and the wake flow. The results suggest that the transition process appears to be physically independent of the wake flow, while the LSB shedding process is locked-in with the von Kármán instability and acts as a sub-harmonic.},

TPLS is at its heart a two-phase flow solver, and uses calls to a range of external libraries to accelerate its performance. However, in the present context we narrow the focus of the study to basic hydrodynamics and parallel computing techniques, and the code is therefore simplified and modified to simulate pressure-driven single-phase flow in a channel, using only relatively simple Fortran 90 code with MPI parallelization, but no calls to any other external libraries. The modified code is analysed in order to both validate its accuracy and investigate its scalability up to 1000 CPU cores. Simulations are performed for several benchmark cases in pressure-driven channel flow, including a turbulent simulation, wherein the turbulence is incorporated via the large-eddy simulation technique.

	abstract = {The linear global instability and resulting transition to turbulence induced by an isolated cylindrical roughness element of height hhh and diameter ddd immersed within an incompressible boundary layer flow along a flat plate is investigated using the joint application of direct numerical simulations and fully three-dimensional global stability analyses. For the range of parameters investigated, base flow computations show that the roughness element induces a wake composed of a central low-speed region surrounded by a three-dimensional shear layer and a pair of low- and high-speed streaks on each of its sides. Results from the global stability analyses highlight the unstable nature of the central low-speed region and its crucial importance in the laminar–turbulent transition process. It is able to sustain two different global instabilities: a sinuous and a varicose one. Each of these globally unstable modes is related to a different physical mechanism. While the varicose mode has its root in the instability of the whole three-dimensional shear layer surrounding the central low-speed region, the sinuous instability turns out to be similar to the von Kármán instability in the two-dimensional cylinder wake and has its root in the lateral shear layers of the separated zone. The aspect ratio of the roughness element plays a key role on the selection of the dominant instability: whereas the flow over thin cylindrical roughness elements transitions due to a sinuous instability of the near-wake region, for larger roughness elements the varicose instability of the central low-speed region turns out to be the dominant one. Direct numerical simulations of the flow past an aspect ratio η=1η=1\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}eta\}=1 (with η=d/hη=d/h\{{\textbackslash}it{\textbackslash}eta\}=d/h) roughness element sustaining only the sinuous instability have revealed that the bifurcation occurring in this particular case is supercritical. Finally, comparison of the transition thresholds predicted by global linear stability analyses with the von Doenhoff–Braslow transition diagram provides qualitatively good agreement.},

As for the 2D-periodic lid-driven cavity flows, the unstable mode originates from a centrifugal instability of the primary vortex core. A Reynolds–Orr analysis reveals that the unstable perturbation relies on a combination of the lift-up and anti lift-up mechanisms to extract its energy from the base flow. Once linearly unstable, direct numerical simulations show that the flow is driven toward a primary limit cycle before eventually exhibiting intermittent chaotic dynamics.

Turbulence is notoriously challenging, in part due to its multiscale nature and the fact that large-scale coherent structures cannot be disentangled from small-scale fluctuations. This closure problem is emblematic of a greater challenge in complex systems, where coarse-graining and statistical mechanics descriptions break down. This work demonstrates an alternative data-driven modeling approach to learn nonlinear models of the coherent structures, approximating turbulent fluctuations as state-dependent stochastic forcing. We demonstrate this approach on a high–Reynolds number turbulent wake experiment, showing that our model reproduces empirical power spectra and probability distributions. The model is interpretable, providing insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the symmetry-breaking behavior in the wake. This work suggests a path toward low-dimensional models of globally unstable turbulent flows from experimental measurements, with broad implications for other multiscale systems.

This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework.

For each regime, we combine proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and statistical tools on long-term data to characterise the dynamics of large-scale structures. For the CR regime, centrosymmetric modes are dominant and display a coherent dynamics, while non-centrosymmetric modes fluctuate randomly. For the EC regime, all POD modes follow Poissonian statistics and a non-centrosymmetric mode is dominant. To explore further the differences between the CR and EC regimes, an analysis based on a cluster partition of the POD phase space is proposed.

The proposed framework is based on the combination of machine learning tools: dimensionality reduction to extract dominant spatial directions from data, reconstruction algorithm to recover encoded data by limited measurements and cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization. For the encoding part, linear and nonlinear extraction of patterns are considered: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), linear autoencoder (LAE) and variational autoencoder (VAE). For the reconstruction part, regressive reconstruction (neural network, linear, support vector, gradient boosting) and library-based reconstruction are compared, each method being cross-validated to ensure good generalization on testing data. The position of sensors is optimized using an enhanced clustering algorithm. The robustness of regressive reconstructions to noise measurements is also addressed, showing the benefits of variational approaches in the reduction phase. The strategy is tested for three increasing complexity flows: 2D vortex shedding (Re=200), 2D spatial mixing layer and 3D vortex shedding (Re=20000). The results suggest that proper machine learning approaches to fluid flow data can lead to effective reconstruction models that can be used for the rapid estimation of complex flows.},

In the control design the loop is closed between the output and the input through a feedback gain. Model reduction approximates the system with a low-order model, making modern control design computationally tractable for systems of large dimensions.

Such generalized inverses are famously represented by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (MPP) which happens to minimize the Frobenius norm. Freeing up the degrees of freedom associated with Frobenius optimality enables us to promote other interesting properties. In this Part I, we look at the basic properties of norm-minimizing generalized inverses, especially in terms of uniqueness and relation to the MPP. We first show that the MPP minimizes many norms beyond those unitarily invariant, thus further bolstering its role as a robust choice in many situations. We then concentrate on some norms which are generally not minimized by the MPP, but whose minimization is relevant for linear inverse problems and sparse representations. In particular, we look at mixed norms and the induced \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}p {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}q\$ norms. An interesting representative is the sparse pseudoinverse which we study in much more detail in Part II. Next, we shift attention from norms to matrices with interesting behaviors. We exhibit a class whose generalized inverse is always the MPP-even for norms that normally result in different inverses-and a class for which many generalized inverses coincide, but not with the MPP. Finally, we discuss efficient computation of norm-minimizing generalized inverses.},

Neglecting these features leads to models with poor predictive accuracy despite being able to accurately encode and decode states. In order to improve predictive accuracy, we propose to optimize the reduced-order model to fit a collection of coarsely sampled trajectories from the original system. In particular, we optimize over the product of two Grassmann manifolds defining Petrov-Galerkin projections of the full-order governing equations. We compare our approach with existing methods including proper orthogonal decomposition, balanced truncation-based Petrov-Galerkin projection, quadratic-bilinear balanced truncation, and the quadratic-bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved accuracy both on a nonlinear toy model and on an incompressible (nonlinear) axisymmetric jet flow with \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ states.},

	abstract = {Optimal sensor and actuator placement is an important unsolved problem in control theory. Nearly every downstream control decision is affected by these sensor and actuator locations, but determining optimal locations amounts to an intractable brute-force search among the combinatorial possibilities. Indeed, there are (np) = n!/((n-p)!p!) possible choices of p point sensors out of an n-dimensional state x. Determining optimal sensor and actuator placement in general, even for linear feedback control, is an open challenge. Instead, sensor and actuator locations are routinely chosen according to heuristics and intuition. For moderate-sized search spaces, the sensor placement problem has well-known model-based solutions using optimal experiment design [1], [2], and information theoretic and Bayesian criteria [3]-[7]. As discussed in "Summary," this article explores how to design optimal sensor locations for signal reconstruction in a framework that scales to arbitrarily large problems, leveraging modern techniques in machine learning and sparse sampling. Reducing the number of sensors through principled selection may be critically enabling when sensors are costly, and it may also enable faster state estimation for low-latency, high-bandwidth control.},

The goal is to recover the full velocity field on a fine grid from coarse measurements of a single (longitudinal) velocity component. A significant fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy for each component is captured by the estimation. A scale-by-scale analysis shows that lower order modes corresponding to large scales are recovered accurately.

	abstract = {In this paper, the recently introduced multi-time-delay linear stochastic estimation technique is thoroughly described, focusing on its fundamental properties and potentialities. In the multi-time-delay approach, the estimate of the temporal evolution of the velocity at a given location in the flow field is obtained from multiple past samples of the unconditional sources. The technique is applied to estimate the velocity in a cavity shear layer flow, based on wall-pressure measurements from multiple sensors. The cavity flow was investigated by performing simultaneous measurements of a single hot-wire probe, traversed on a fine grid in the shear layer, and of multiple wall-mounted condenser microphones in the cavity region. The paper compares classical high-order single-time-delay estimation approaches with the multi-time-delay technique, which is significantly more accurate as it produces a much lower mean-square estimation error, thus providing a faithful reconstruction of the time-evolution of the velocity field. This improved accuracy is strongly dependent on the number n of past wall-pressure samples used in the estimate. In this paper, we also demonstrate that the estimated velocity field only contains the signature of the relevant flow mechanisms which correlate well with the wall-pressure, while incoherent components are filtered out. The multi-time-delay approach successfully captures the spatio-temporal dynamics of the velocity fluctuation distribution in the shear layer, as it clearly resolves the dynamics of the relevant flow structures. The effect of the number of sensors used in the estimate was also considered. In general, it was evident that use of more sensors leads to better accuracy, but as the number n of past values increases, the gain becomes marginal.},

First, we propose a constrained Galerkin formulation that corrects the standard Galerkin statement by incorporating prior information about the long-time attractor. For explicit and semi-implicit time discretizations, our statement reads as a constrained quadratic programming problem where the objective function is the Euclidean norm of the error in the reduced Galerkin (algebraic) formulation, while the constraints correspond to bounds for the maximum and minimum value of the coefficients of the N-term expansion. Second, we propose an a posteriori error indicator, which corresponds to the dual norm of the residual associated with the time-averaged momentum equation. We demonstrate that the error indicator is highly-correlated with the error in mean flow prediction, and can be efficiently computed through an offline/online strategy. Third, we propose a Greedy algorithm for the construction of an approximation space/procedure valid over a range of parameters; the Greedy is informed by the a posteriori error indicator developed in this paper. We illustrate our approach and we demonstrate its effectiveness by studying the dependence of a two-dimensional turbulent lid-driven cavity flow on the Reynolds number.},

The PBDW algorithm is a state estimation method involving reduced models. It aims at approximating an unknown function \$u{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm true\}\$ living in a high-dimensional Hilbert space from \$M\$ measurement observations given in the form \$y\_m = {\textbackslash}ell\_m(u{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm true\}),{\textbackslash}, m=1,{\textbackslash}dots,M\$, where \${\textbackslash}ell\_m\$ are linear functionals. The method approximates \$u{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm true\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}hat\{u\} = {\textbackslash}hat\{z\} + {\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\$. The {\textbackslash}emph\{background\} \${\textbackslash}hat\{z\}\$ belongs to an \$N\$-dimensional linear space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\_N\$ built from reduced modelling of a parameterized mathematical model, and the {\textbackslash}emph\{update\} \${\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\$ belongs to the space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{U\}\_M\$ spanned by the Riesz representers of \$({\textbackslash}ell\_1,{\textbackslash}dots, {\textbackslash}ell\_M)\$. When the measurements are noisy \{--- i.e., \$y\_m = {\textbackslash}ell\_m(u{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm true\})+{\textbackslash}epsilon\_m\$ with \${\textbackslash}epsilon\_m\$ being a noise term --- \} the classical PBDW formulation is not robust in the sense that, if \$N\$ increases, the reconstruction accuracy degrades. In this paper, we propose to address this issue with an extension of the classical formulation, \{which consists in\} searching for the background \${\textbackslash}hat\{z\}\$ either on the whole \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\_N\$ in the noise-free case, or on a well-chosen subset \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\_N {\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\_N\$ in presence of noise. The restriction to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\_N\$ makes the reconstruction be nonlinear and is the key to make the algorithm significantly more robust against noise. We \{further\} present an {\textbackslash}emph\{a priori\} error and stability analysis, and we illustrate the efficiency of the approach on several numerical examples.},

	abstract = {The challenges of understanding the impacts of air pollution require detailed information on the state of air quality. While many modeling approaches attempt to treat this problem, physically-based deterministic methods are often overlooked due to their costly computational requirements and complicated implementation. In this work we extend a non-intrusive Reduced Basis Data Assimilation method (known as PBDW state estimation) to large pollutant dispersion case studies relying on equations involved in chemical transport models for air quality modeling. This, with the goal of rendering methods based on parameterized partial differential equations (PDE) feasible in air quality modeling applications requiring quasi-real-time approximation and correction of model error in imperfect models. Reduced basis methods (RBM) aim to compute a cheap and accurate approximation of a physical state using approximation spaces made of a suitable sample of solutions to the model. One of the keys of these techniques is the decomposition of the computational work into an expensive one-time offline stage and a low-cost parameter-dependent online stage. Traditional RBMs require modifying the assembly routines of the computational code, an intrusive procedure which may be impossible in cases of operational model codes. We propose a less intrusive reduced order method using data assimilation for measured pollution concentrations, adapted for consideration of the scale and specific application to exterior pollutant dispersion as can be found in urban air quality studies. Common statistical techniques of data assimilation in use in these applications require large historical data sets, or time-consuming iterative methods. The method proposed here avoids both disadvantages. In the case studies presented in this work, the method allows to correct for unmodeled physics and treat cases of unknown parameter values, all while significantly reducing online computational time.},

The maximization of the determinant of the matrix which appears in pseudo-inverse matrix operations is employed as an objective function of the problem in the present extended approach. The procedure for the maximization of the determinant of the corresponding matrix is proved to be mathematically the same as that of the previously proposed QR method when the number of sensors is less than that of state variables (undersampling). On the other hand, the authors have developed a new algorithm for when the number of sensors is greater than that of state variables (oversampling). Then, a unified formulation of the two algorithms is derived, and the lower bound of the objective function given by this algorithm is shown using the monotone submodularity of the objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the problem using real datasets is demonstrated by comparing with the results of other algorithms. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm improves the estimation error by approximately 10\% compared with the conventional methods in the oversampling case, where the estimation error is defined as the ratio of the difference between the reconstructed data and the full observation data to the full observation. For the NOAA-SST sensor problem, which has more than ten thousand sensor candidate points, the proposed algorithm selects the sensor positions in few seconds, which required several hours with the other algorithms in the oversampling case on a 3.40 GHz computer.},

	abstract = {We present a systematic approach for determining the optimal actuator location for separation control from input–output response data, gathered from numerical simulations or physical experiments. The Eigensystem realization algorithm is used to extract state-space descriptions from the response data associated with a candidate set of actuator locations. These system realizations are then used to determine the actuator location among the set that can drive the system output to an arbitrary value with minimal control effort. The solution of the corresponding minimum energy optimal control problem is evaluated by computing the generalized output controllability Gramian. We use the method to analyze high-ﬁdelity numerical simulation data of the lift and separation angle responses to a pulse of localized body-force actuation from six distinct locations on the upper surface of a NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil. We ﬁnd that the optimal location for controlling lift is different from the optimal location for controlling separation angle. In order to explain the physical mechanisms underlying these differences, we conduct controllability analyses of the ﬂowﬁeld by leveraging the dynamic mode decomposition with control algorithm. These modal analyses of ﬂowﬁeld response data reveal that excitation of coherent structures in the wake beneﬁts lift control, whereas excitation of coherent structures in the shear layer beneﬁts separation angle control.},

The Bayesian estimation with a covariance matrix of the measurement noise and a prior probability distribution of estimating parameters, which are given by the modal decomposition of high dimensional data, robustly works even in the presence of the correlated noise. After computational efficiency of the algorithm is improved by a low-rank approximation of the noise covariance matrix, the proposed algorithms are applied to various problems. The proposed method yields more accurate reconstruction than the previously presented method with the determinant-based greedy algorithm, with reasonable increase in computational time.},

The linear terms of the governing equations are reduced by Galerkin projection onto a POD basis of the flow state, while the reduced non- linear convection terms are obtained either by a Galerkin projection onto the same state basis, by a Galerkin projection onto a POD basis representing the nonlinearities or by applying the Discrete Empir- ical Interpolation Method (DEIM) to a POD basis of the nonlinearities. The quality of the reduced order models is assessed as to their stability, accuracy and robustness, and appropriate quantitative measures are introduced and compared. In particular, the properties of the reduced linear terms are compared to those of the full-scale terms, and the structure of the nonlinear quadratic terms is analyzed as to the con- servation of kinetic energy. It is shown that all three reduction techniques provide excellent and similar results for the cases of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the limit-cycle cylinder flow. For the case of the transient regime of flow past a cylinder, only the pure Galerkin techniques are successful, while the DEIM technique produces reduced-order models that diverge in finite time.},

	doi = {10.1109/CDC.2009.5400045},
	abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for unsteady and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. Empirical interpolation posed in finite dimensional function space is a modification of POD that reduces complexity of the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of unsteady time dependent PDE and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of EIM in a finite dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the 1-D FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captured non-linear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results.},

The parameters can be tuned for each problem to speed up the convergence of a Krylov-subspace-based linear algebra solver. This operator can be inverted by the Uzawa-like algorithm, and does not need a time-stepping. Second, we propose to generate an initial guess of steady flow, leading eigenvalue and eigenvector using orthogonal projection on a divergence-free basis satisfying all boundary conditions. The approach, including the two proposed techniques, is illustrated on the solution of the linear stability problem for laterally heated square and cubic cavities.},

An approximate eigensystem procedure that only needs the Frechet derivative is used to extract the least damped eigenmodes.

In this approach to turbulence decomposition, which has recently been termed Spectral POD (SPOD), Fourier modes are considered as solutions to the corresponding Fredholm integral equation of the second kind along homogeneous-periodic or homogeneous coordinates. In the present work, the notion that the POD modes formally converge to Fourier modes for increasing domain length is challenged. Numerical results indicate that the discrepancy between POD and Fourier modes along {\textbackslash}textit\{locally\} translationally invariant coordinates is coupled to the Taylor macro/micro scale ratio (MMSR) of the kernel in question. Increasing discrepancies are observed for smaller MMSRs, which are characteristic of low Reynolds number flows. It is observed that the asymptotic convergence rate of the eigenspectrum matches the corresponding convergence rate of the exact analytical Fourier spectrum of the kernel in question - even for extremely small domains and small MMSRs where the corresponding DFT spectra suffer heavily from windowing effects. These results indicate that the accumulated discrepancies between POD and Fourier modes play a role in producing the spectral convergence rates expected from Fourier transforms of translationally invariant kernels on infinite domains.},

	title = {Conditional space-time {POD} extensions for stability and prediction analysis},
	abstract = {The correlation and extraction of coherent structures from a turbulent flow is a principle objective of data-driven modal decomposition techniques. The Conditional space-time Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (CPOD) offers insight into transient dynamics, revealing the causation of specific flow phenomenon - or events, in a customizable manner. This work exploits the temporal evolution of CPOD modes in a reduced subspace, resulting in new extensions and adaptations that meet or exceed the capabilities of other decomposition methods. Chiefly, it is demonstrated that the subsequent application of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to CPOD modes, provides a flexible tool to investigate targeted flow instabilities, both tonal and convective in nature. By extending the CPOD time-horizon to educe the former type, it is shown that CPOD-DMD can exactly reproduce Spectral POD modes. Regarding the latter, a multi-resolution framework (CPOD-mrDMD) yields a refined "cause and effect" stability analysis, capable of diagnosing the natural forcing mechanisms within the flow, and the resulting unstable modes. In a separate application, CPOD properties are appreciated in the context of reduced order models, with an example of real-time flow prediction of extreme events derived from an active sensor correlated to a CPOD mode. The various CPOD functions and perspectives in this work are demonstrated on: the nonlinear chaotic Lorenz system, 3D intermittent turbulent spots in supersonic boundary layer transition, Schlieren video processing of unstarted inlet buzz, the aeroacoustic feedback forcing of a resonating impinging jet, and prediction of intermittent bluff-body wake structures impinging on a channel wall.},

	abstract = {We develop a multiscale approach to estimate high-dimensional probability distributions from a dataset of physical fields or configurations observed in experiments or simulations. In this way we can estimate energy functions (or Hamiltonians) and efficiently generate new samples of many-body systems in various domains, from statistical physics to cosmology. Our method -- the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group (WC-RG) -- proceeds scale by scale, estimating models for the conditional probabilities of "fast degrees of freedom" conditioned by coarse-grained fields. These probability distributions are modeled by energy functions associated with scale interactions, and are represented in an orthogonal wavelet basis. WC-RG decomposes the microscopic energy function as a sum of interaction energies at all scales and can efficiently generate new samples by going from coarse to fine scales. Near phase transitions, it avoids the "critical slowing down" of direct estimation and sampling algorithms. This is explained theoretically by combining results from RG and wavelet theories, and verified numerically for the Gaussian and \${\textbackslash}varphi{\textasciicircum}4\$ field theories. We show that multiscale WC-RG energy-based models are more general than local potential models and can capture the physics of complex many-body interacting systems at all length scales. This is demonstrated for weak-gravitational-lensing fields reflecting dark matter distributions in cosmology, which include long-range interactions with long-tail probability distributions. WC-RG has a large number of potential applications in non-equilibrium systems, where the underlying distribution is not known \{{\textbackslash}it a priori\}. Finally, we discuss the connection between WC-RG and deep network architectures.},

In the offline stage, the reduced basis functions are extracted by a two-step proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm. Then, a novel hybrid DMD regression model that combines windowed DMD and optimized DMD is introduced for the temporal evolution of the RB coefficients. To improve the stability of this method for complex nonlinear problems, we introduce a threshold value to modify the DMD eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Moreover, the interpolation of the coefficients in parameter space is conducted by a feedforward neural network or random forest algorithm. The prediction of the RB solution at a new time/parameter value can be recovered at a low computational cost in the online stage, which is completely decoupled from the high-fidelity dimension. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed model with two cases: (i) laminar flow past a two-dimensional cylinder and (ii) turbulent flow around a three-dimensional SD7003 airfoil. The results show reasonable efficiency and robustness of this novel reduced-order model.},

In particular, the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a block Hankel matrix formed from successive delay embeddings of the state of a dynamical system lies at the heart of several popular reduced-order modeling methods. In this paper, we show that the left singular vectors of this Hankel matrix are a discrete approximation of classical space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes, and the singular values are square roots of the POD energies. This connection establishes a clear interpretation of the Hankel modes grounded in classical theory, and we gain insights into the Hankel modes by instead analyzing the equivalent discrete space-time POD modes in terms of the correlation matrix formed by multiplying the Hankel matrix by its conjugate transpose. These insights include the distinct meaning of rows and columns, the implied norm in which the modes are optimal, the impact of the time step between snapshots on the modes, and an interpretation of the embedding dimension/height of the Hankel matrix in terms of the time window on which the modes are optimal. Moreover, the connections we establish offer opportunities to improve the convergence and computation time in certain practical cases, and to improve the accuracy of the modes with the same data. Finally, popular variants of POD, namely the standard space-only POD and spectral POD, are recovered in the limits that snapshots used to form each column of the Hankel matrix represent flow evolution over short and long times, respectively.},

A recent line of work indicates that a hybrid of classical numerical techniques with machine learning can offer significant improvements over either approach alone. In this work, we show that the choice of the numerical scheme is crucial when incorporating physics-based priors. We build upon Fourier-based spectral methods, which are considerably more efficient than other numerical schemes for simulating PDEs with smooth and periodic solutions. Specifically, we develop ML-augmented spectral solvers for three model PDEs of fluid dynamics, which improve upon the accuracy of standard spectral solvers at the same resolution. We also demonstrate a handful of key design principles for combining machine learning and numerical methods for solving PDEs.},

	abstract = {Data-driven reduced-order models often fail to make accurate forecasts of high-dimensional nonlinear systems that are sensitive along coordinates with low-variance because such coordinates are often truncated, e.g., by proper orthogonal decomposition, kernel principal component analysis, and autoencoders. Such systems are encountered frequently in shear-dominated fluid flows where non-normality plays a significant role in the growth of disturbances. In order to address these issues, we employ ideas from active subspaces to find low-dimensional systems of coordinates for model reduction that balance adjoint-based information about the system's sensitivity with the variance of states along trajectories. The resulting method, which we refer to as covariance balancing reduction using adjoint snapshots (CoBRAS), is analogous to balanced truncation with state and adjoint-based gradient covariance matrices replacing the system Gramians and obeying the same key transformation laws. Here, the extracted coordinates are associated with an oblique projection that can be used to construct Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order models. We provide an efficient snapshot-based computational method analogous to balanced proper orthogonal decomposition. This also leads to the observation that the reduced coordinates can be computed relying on inner products of state and gradient samples alone, allowing us to find rich nonlinear coordinates by replacing the inner product with a kernel function. In these coordinates, reduced-order models can be learned using regression. We demonstrate these techniques and compare to a variety of other methods on a simple, yet challenging three-dimensional system and an axisymmetric jet flow simulation with \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ state variables.},

Unfortunately, the subset selection problem for detection under dependent observations is combinatorial in nature and suboptimal subset selection algorithms must be employed. In this work, different from the widely used convex relaxation of the problem, we leverage submodularity, the diminishing returns property, to provide practical near optimal algorithms suitable for large-scale subset selection.

Since the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is also uncertain in this context, to achieve a robust signal extraction, we propose a new placement criterion based on the maximization of the probability that the SNR exceeds a given threshold. This criterion can be easily evaluated using the Gaussian process assumption. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the joint maximization of the criterion with respect to all sensor positions, we suggest a sequential maximization approach, where the sensor positions are chosen one at a time. Finally, we present numerical results showing the superior robustness of the proposed approach when compared to standard sensor placement criteria aimed at interpolating the spatial gain and to a recently proposed criterion aimed at maximizing the average SNR.},

Recent work has indicated that the simple greedy algorithm, which chooses the sensor at each time step that maximizes the error covariance reduction, outperforms many other known scheduling algorithms. In addition, it has been suggested that the cost function mapping a sensor sequence to an error covariance cost is submodular; this would imply that the greedy algorithm provides a near optimal sensor schedule. As a negative result, we show that the sensor schedule cost is not, in general, a submodular function. This contradicts an established result. We argue that given a linear dynamical system, it is computationally intractable to determine if it will yield a submodular cost. Thus, we provide sufﬁcient and easily checkable conditions under which the dynamical system yields a submodular cost, and thus performance guarantees for the greedy schedule.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on sensor scheduling for state estimation, which consists of a network of noisy sensors and a discrete-time linear system with process noise. As an energy constraint, only a subset of sensors can take a measurement at each time step. These measurements are fused into a common state estimate using a Kalman ﬁlter and the goal is to schedule the sensors to minimize the estimation error at a terminal time. A simple approach is to greedily choose sensors at each time step to minimize the estimation error at the next time step. Recent work has shown that this greedy algorithm outperforms other well known approaches. Results have been established to show that the estimation error is a submodular function of the sensor schedule; submodular functions have a diminishing returns property that ensures the greedy algorithm yields near optimal performance. As a negative result, we show that most commonly-used estimation error metrics are not, in general, submodular functions. This disproves an established result. We then provide suﬃcient conditions on the system for which the estimation error is a submodular function of the sensor schedule, and thus the greedy algorithm yields performance guarantees.},

	abstract = {This work provides performance guarantees for the greedy solution of experimental design problems. In particular, it focuses on A- and E-optimal designs, for which typical guarantees do not apply since the mean-square error and the maximum eigenvalue of the estimation error covariance matrix are not supermodular. To do so, it leverages the concept of approximate supermodularity to derive non-asymptotic worst-case suboptimality bounds for these greedy solutions. These bounds reveal that as the SNR of the experiments decreases, these cost functions behave increasingly as supermodular functions. As such, greedy A- and E-optimal designs approach (1-1/e)-optimality. These results reconcile the empirical success of greedy experimental design with the non-supermodularity of the A- and E-optimality criteria.},

Weak submodularity has been used to show that many (monotone) functions that arise in practice can be efficiently maximized with provable guarantees.

We show that an efficient randomized greedy algorithm has provable approximation guarantees for maximizing these functions subject to a cardinality constraint. We then provide a more refined analysis that takes into account that the weak submodularity parameter may change (sometimes improving) throughout the execution of the algorithm.

	abstract = {We initiate the study of property testing of submodularity on the boolean hypercube. Submodular functions come up in a variety of applications in combinatorial optimization. For a vast range of algorithms, the existence of an oracle to a submodular function is assumed. But how does one check if this oracle indeed represents a submodular function? Consider a function f:\{0,1\}{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}rightarrow R. The distance to submodularity is the minimum fraction of values of \$f\$ that need to be modified to make f submodular. If this distance is more than epsilon {\textgreater} 0, then we say that f is epsilon-far from being submodular. The aim is to have an efficient procedure that, given input f that is epsilon-far from being submodular, certifies that f is not submodular. We analyze a very natural tester for this problem, and prove that it runs in subexponential time. This gives the first non-trivial tester for submodularity. On the other hand, we prove an interesting lower bound (that is, unfortunately, quite far from the upper bound) suggesting that this tester cannot be very efficient in terms of epsilon. This involves non-trivial examples of functions which are far from submodular and yet do not exhibit too many local violations. We also provide some constructions indicating the difficulty in designing a tester for submodularity. We construct a partial function defined on exponentially many points that cannot be extended to a submodular function, but any strict subset of these values can be extended to a submodular function.},

	abstract = {Koopman analysis provides a general framework from which to analyze a nonlinear dynamical system in terms of a linear operator acting on an infinite-dimensional observable space. This theoretical framework provides a rigorous underpinning for widely used dynamic mode decomposition algorithms. While such methods have proven to be remarkably useful in the analysis of time-series data, the resulting linear models must generally be of high order to accurately approximate fundamentally nonlinear behaviors. This issue poses an inherent risk of overfitting to training data thereby limiting predictive capabilities. By contrast, this work explores strategies for nonlinear data-driven estimation of the action of the Koopman operator. General strategies that yield nonlinear models are presented for systems both with and without control. Subsequent projection of the resulting nonlinear equations onto a low-rank basis yields a low order representation for the underlying dynamical system. In both computational and experimental examples considered in this work, linear estimators of the Koopman operator are generally only able to provide short-term predictions for the observable dynamics while comparable nonlinear estimators provide accurate predictions on substantially longer timescales and replicate infinite-time behaviors that linear predictors cannot.},

We use this connection to propose a data-driven algorithm for feedback linearization. Particularly, we use experimental data to identify the state transformation and control feedback from a dictionary of functions for which feedback linearization is achieved in a least-squares sense. Finally, we provide numerical examples for the data-driven algorithm and compare it with model-based feedback linearization. We also numerically study the effect of the richness of the dictionary and the size of the data set on the effectiveness of feedback linearization.},

The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a cornerstone for modelling high-dimensional systems from data. However, the quality of the linear DMD model is known to be fragile with respect to strong nonlinearity, which contaminates the model estimate. By contrast, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics learns fully nonlinear models, disambiguating the linear and nonlinear effects, but is restricted to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we present a kernel method that learns interpretable data-driven models for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Our method performs kernel regression on a sparse dictionary of samples that appreciably contribute to the dynamics. We show that this kernel method efficiently handles high-dimensional data and is flexible enough to incorporate partial knowledge of system physics. It is possible to recover the linear model contribution with this approach, thus separating the effects of the implicitly defined nonlinear terms. We demonstrate our approach on data from a range of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations. This framework can be used for many practical engineering tasks such as model order reduction, diagnostics, prediction, control and discovery of governing laws.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) describes complex dynamic processes through a hierarchy of simpler coherent features. DMD is regularly used to understand the fundamental characteristics of turbulence and is closely related to Koopman operators. However, verifying the decomposition, equivalently the computed spectral features of Koopman operators, remains a major challenge due to the infinite-dimensional nature of Koopman operators. Challenges include spurious (unphysical) modes, and dealing with continuous spectra, both of which occur regularly in turbulent flows. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD), introduced by (Colbrook \& Townsend 2021), overcomes some of these challenges through the data-driven computation of residuals associated with the full infinite-dimensional Koopman operator. ResDMD computes spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators with error control, and computes smoothed approximations of spectral measures (including continuous spectra) with explicit high-order convergence theorems. ResDMD thus provides robust and verified Koopmanism. We implement ResDMD and demonstrate its application in a variety of fluid dynamic situations, at varying Reynolds numbers, arising from both numerical and experimental data. Examples include: vortex shedding behind a cylinder; hot-wire data acquired in a turbulent boundary layer; particle image velocimetry data focusing on a wall-jet flow; and acoustic pressure signals of laser-induced plasma. We present some advantages of ResDMD, namely, the ability to verifiably resolve non-linear, transient modes, and spectral calculation with reduced broadening effects. We also discuss how a new modal ordering based on residuals enables greater accuracy with a smaller dictionary than the traditional modulus ordering. This paves the way for greater dynamic compression of large datasets without sacrificing accuracy.},

Therefore, NPE is less sensitive to outliers than PCA. Also, comparing to the recently proposed manifold learning algorithms such as Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding, NPE is deﬁned everywhere, rather than only on the training data points. Furthermore, NPE may be conducted in the original space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space into which data points are mapped. This gives rise to kernel NPE.

For continuous or mixed (discrete and continuous) spectra, DMD can be augmented with an external forcing term. We present a method for learning linear control models in delay coordinates while simultaneously discovering the corresponding exogenous forcing signal in a fully unsupervised manner. This extends the existing DMD with control (DMDc) algorithm to cases where a control signal is not known a priori. We provide examples to validate the learned forcing against a known ground truth and illustrate their statistical similarity. Finally, we offer a demonstration of this method applied to real-world power grid load data to show its utility for diagnostics and interpretation on systems in which somewhat periodic behavior is strongly forced by unknown and unmeasurable environmental variables.},

Model reduction involves finding low-dimensional models that approximate the full high-dimensional dynamics.

Balanced truncation produces better reduced-order models than POD, but is not computationally tractable for very large systems. Balanced POD is a tractable method for computing approximate balanced truncations, that has computational cost similar to that of POD. The method presented here is a variation of existing methods using empirical Gramians, and the main contributions of the present paper are a version of the method of snapshots that allows one to compute balancing transformations directly, without separate reduction of the Gramians; and an output projection method, which allows tractable computation even when the number of outputs is large. The output projection method requires minimal additional computation, and has a priori error bounds that can guide the choice of rank of the projection. Connections between POD and balanced truncation are also illuminated: in particular, balanced truncation may be viewed as POD of a particular dataset, using the observability Gramian as an inner product. The three methods are illustrated on a numerical example, the linearized flow in a plane channel.},

They still include extra model parameters which give unnecessarily high variance, and also cause bias for closed-loop data. In this paper, a new model formulation is suggested that circumvents the problem. Within the framework, the system matrices (A,B,C,D) and Markov parameters can be estimated separately. It is demonstrated through analysis that the new methods generally give smaller variance in the estimate of the observability matrix and it is supported by simulation studies that this gives lower variance also of the system invariants such as the poles.},

State-space model estimation requires only simple regression, and state order selection involves the optimal Akaike information criterion procedure. The CVA method extends to time-varying and abruptly changing systems. A reduce-rank stochastic model predictive control problem is shown to be equivalent to the CVA problem.

	abstract = {The elementary MOESP algorithm presented in the first part of this series of papers is analysed in this paper. This is done in three different ways. First, we study the asymptotic properties of the estimated state-space model when only considering zero-mean white noise perturbations on the output sequence. It is shown that, in this case, the MOESPl implementation yields asymptotically unbiased estimates. An important constraint to this result is that the underlying system must have a finite impulse response and subsequently the size of the Hankel matrices, constructed from the input and output data at the beginning of the computations, depends on the number of non-zero Markov parameters. This analysis, however, leads to a second implementation of the elementary MOESP scheme, namely MOESP2. The latter implementation has the same asymptotic properties without the finite impulse response constraint. Secondly, we compare the MOESP2 algorithm with a classical state space model identification scheme. The latter scheme, referred to as the CLASSIC algorithm, is based on the Ho and Kalman realization scheme and estimated Markov parameters. The comparison is done by a sensitivity study, where the effect is studied of the errors on the data on the calculated column space of the shift-invariant subspace. This study demonstrates that the elementary MOESP2 scheme is more robust with respect to the errors considered than the CLASSIC algorithm. In the third part, the model reduction capabilities of the elementary MOESP schemes are analysed when the observations are error-free. We demonstrate in which sense the reduced order model is optimal when acquired with the MOESP schemes. The optimality is expressed by the difference between the 2-norm of the errors on the state (or output) sequence of the reduced-order model and the 2-norm of the matrix containing the rejected singular values being as small as possible. The insights obtained in these three parts are evaluated in a simulation study, and validated in this paper. They lead to the assertion that the MOESP2 implementation allows identification of a compact, low-dimensional, state-space model accurately describing the input -output behaviour of the system to be identified, while making use of ‘perturbed’ input-output data. This can be done efficiently.},

	abstract = {The ordinary MOESP algorithm presented in the first part of this series of papers is analysed and extended in this paper. First, an analysis is made which proves that the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimated state-space quadruple [AT, BT, CT, D] critically depends on the unbiased calculation of the column space of the extended observability matrix. Second, it is proved that the latter quantity can be calculated asymptotically unbiasedly only when the stochastic additive errors on the output quantity are zero-mean white noise. The extension of the ordinary MOESP scheme with instrumental variables increases the applicability of this scheme. Two types of instrumental variables are proposed: (1) based on past input measurements; and (2) based on reconstructed state quantities. The first type yields asymptotic unbiased estimates when the perturbation on the output quantity is an arbitrary zero-mean stochastic process independent of the error-free input. However, a detailed sensitivity analysis demonstrates that for the finite data-length case the calculations can become very sensitive; this occurs when the particular system at hand has dominant modes close to the unit circle. In the same sensitivity analysis it is shown that far more robust results can be obtained with the second type of instrumental variables when the true state quantities are used. A number of guidelines are derived from the given sensitivity analysis to obtain accurate reconstructed state quantities. Efficient numerical implementations are presented for both extensions of the ordinary MOESP scheme. The obtained insights are verified by means of two realistic simulation studies. The developed extensions and strategy in these studies demonstrate excellent performances in the treatment of both identification problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present two novel algorithms to realize a finite dimensional, linear time-invariant state-space model from input-output data. The algorithms have a number of common features. They are classified as one of the subspace model identification schemes, in that a major part of the identification problem consists of calculating specially structured subspaces of spaces defined by the input-output data. This structure is then exploited in the calculation of a realization. Another common feature is their algorithmic organization: an RQ factorization followed by a singular value decomposition and the solution of an overdetermined set (or sets) of equations. The schemes assume that the underlying system has an output-error structure and that a measurable input sequence is available. The latter characteristic indicates that both schemes are versions of the MIMO Output-Error State Space model identification (MOESP) approach. The first algorithm is denoted in particular as the (elementary MOESP scheme). The subspace approximation step requires, in addition to input-output data, knowledge of a restricted set of Markov parameters. The second algorithm, referred to as the (ordinary MOESP scheme), solely relies on input-output data. A compact implementation is presented of both schemes. Although we restrict our presentation here to error-free input-output data, a framework is set up in an identification context.

These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid \& Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures.},

	abstract = {The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator-theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: (1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems; (2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big data and machine learning techniques; and (3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.},

Koopman operator theory circumvents some of these issues by considering the dynamics in the space of observable functions on the state, in which the dynamics are intrinsically linear and thus amenable to standard techniques from numerical analysis and linear algebra. However, practical issues remain with this approach, as the space of observables is infinite dimensional and selecting a subspace of functions in which to accurately represent the system is a nontrivial task. In this work we consider time-delay observables to represent nonlinear dynamics in the Koopman operator framework. We prove the surprising result that Koopman operators for different systems admit universal (system-independent) representations in these coordinates, and give analytic expressions for these representations. In addition, we show that for certain systems a restricted class of these observables form an optimal finite-dimensional basis for representing the Koopman operator, and that the analytic representation of the Koopman operator in these coordinates coincides with results computed by the dynamic mode decomposition. We provide numerical examples to complement our results. In addition to being theoretically interesting, these results have implications for a number of linearization algorithms for dynamical systems.},

This includes the classical measure-preserving systems, as well as systems whose attractors support a physical measure. Our approach relies on the observation that vector projections in DMD can be used to approximate the function projections by the virtue of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem. Using this fact, we show that applying DMD to Hankel data matrices in the limit of infinite-time observations yields the true Koopman eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. We also show that the singular value decomposition, which is the central part of most DMD algorithms, converges to the proper orthogonal decomposition of observables.

	abstract = {, This paper focuses on finding a closed-loop strategy to reduce the drag of a cylinder in laminar flow conditions. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been implemented to discover efficient control schemes, using two synthetic jets located on the cylinder's poles as actuators and pressure sensors in the wake of the cylinder as feedback observation. The present work focuses on the efficiency and robustness of the identified control strategy and introduces a novel algorithm (S-PPO-CMA) to optimise the sensor layout. An energy-efficient control strategy reducing drag by 18.4\%18.4\%18.4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\% at a Reynolds number of 120120120 is obtained. This control policy is shown to be robust both to a Reynolds-number variation in the range [100;216][100;216][100;216] and to measurement noise, for signal-to-noise ratios as low as 0.20.20.2 with negligible impact on performance. Along with a systematic study on sensor number and location, the proposed sparsity-seeking algorithm has achieved a successful optimisation to a reduced five-sensor layout while keeping state-of-the-art performance. These results further highlight the interesting possibilities of reinforcement learning for active flow control and pave the way to efficient, robust and practical implementations of these control techniques in experimental or industrial systems.},

	abstract = {Reducing sensor requirements while keeping optimal control performance is crucial to many industrial control applications to achieve robust, low-cost, and computation-efficient controllers. However, existing feature selection solutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the domain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework, namely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can efficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic control. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with twisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can quantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A well-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for evaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes layout with 18.7\% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151 probes and 49.2\% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also apply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS achieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided solutions. Results highlight, we argued, a new way to achieve efficient and optimal sensor designs for experimental or industrial systems.

	abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is an Arnoldi-like method based on the Koopman operator. It analyzes empirical data, typically generated by nonlinear dynamics, and computes eigenvalues and eigenmodes of an approximate linear model. Without explicit knowledge of the dynamical operator, it extracts frequencies, growth rates, and spatial structures for each mode. We show that expansion in DMD modes is unique under certain conditions. When constructing mode-based reduced-order models of partial differential equations, subtracting a mean from the data set is typically necessary to satisfy boundary conditions. Subtracting the mean of the data exactly reduces DMD to the temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT); this is restrictive and generally undesirable. On the other hand, subtracting an equilibrium point generally preserves the DMD spectrum and modes. Next, we introduce an “optimized” DMD that computes an arbitrary number of dynamical modes from a data set. Compared to DMD, optimized DMD is superior at calculating physically relevant frequencies, and is less numerically sensitive. We test these decomposition methods on data from a two-dimensional cylinder fluid flow at a Reynolds number of 60. Time-varying modes computed from the DMD variants yield low projection errors.},

	abstract = {The identiﬁcation of coherent structures from experimental or numerical data is an essential task when conducting research in ﬂuid dynamics. This typically involves the construction of an empirical mode base that appropriately captures the dominant ﬂow structures. The most prominent candidates are the energy-ranked proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the frequency-ranked Fourier decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). However, these methods are not suitable when the relevant coherent structures occur at low energies or at multiple frequencies, which is often the case. To overcome the deﬁcit of these ‘rigid’ approaches, we propose a new method termed spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). It is based on classical POD and it can be applied to spatially and temporally resolved data. The new method involves an additional temporal constraint that enables a clear separation of phenomena that occur at multiple frequencies and energies. SPOD allows for a continuous shifting from the energetically optimal POD to the spectrally pure Fourier decomposition by changing a single parameter. In this article, SPOD is motivated from phenomenological considerations of the POD autocorrelation matrix and justiﬁed from dynamical systems theory. The new method is further applied to three sets of PIV measurements of ﬂows from very different engineering problems. We consider the ﬂow of a swirl-stabilized combustor, the wake of an airfoil with a Gurney ﬂap and the ﬂow ﬁeld of the sweeping jet behind a ﬂuidic oscillator. For these examples, the commonly used methods fail to assign the relevant coherent structures to single modes. The SPOD, however, achieves a proper separation of spatially and temporally coherent structures, which are either hidden in stochastic turbulent ﬂuctuations or spread over a wide frequency range. The SPOD requires only one additional parameter, which can be estimated from the basic time scales of the ﬂow. In spite of all these beneﬁts, the algorithmic complexity and computational cost of the SPOD are only marginally greater than those of the snapshot POD.},

In addition, we provide a novel method for timelag selection when delay-embedding signals from multimodal systems. We show that our alternative approach to data-driven SSM construction yields accurate and sparse rigorous models for essentially nonlinear (or non-linearizable) dynamics on both numerical and experimental datasets. Aside from a major reduction in complexity, our new method allows an increase in the training data dimensionality by several orders of magnitude.

In contrast, a spectral submanifold (SSM) is an invariant manifold asymptotic to a NNM, serving as the smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace of the linearized system along the NNM. The existence and uniqueness of SSMs turns out to depend on a spectral quotient computed from the real part of the spectrum of the linearized system. This quotient may well be large even for small dissipation; thus, the inclusion of damping is essential for firm conclusions about NNMs, SSMs and the reduced-order models they yield.},

This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth’s magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are strongly nonlinear.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1710.06532},
	abstract = {Starting from measured data, we develop a method to compute the fine structure of the spectrum of the Koopman operator with rigorous convergence guarantees. The method is based on the observation that, in the measure-preserving ergodic setting, the moments of the spectral measure associated to a given observable are computable from a single trajectory of this observable. Having finitely many moments available, we use the classical Christoffel-Darboux kernel to separate the atomic and absolutely continuous parts of the spectrum, supported by convergence guarantees as the number of moments tends to infinity. In addition, we propose a technique to detect the singular continuous part of the spectrum as well as two methods to approximate the spectral measure with guaranteed convergence in the weak topology, irrespective of whether the singular continuous part is present or not. The proposed method is simple to implement and readily applicable to large-scale systems since the computational complexity is dominated by inverting an \$N{\textbackslash}times N\$ Hermitian positive-definite Toeplitz matrix, where \$N\$ is the number of moments, for which efficient and numerically stable algorithms exist; in particular, the complexity of the approach is independent of the dimension of the underlying state-space. We also show how to compute, from measured data, the spectral projection on a given segment of the unit circle, allowing us to obtain a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator that explicitly takes into account the point and continuous parts of the spectrum. Finally, we describe a relationship between the proposed method and the so-called Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition, providing new insights into the behavior of the eigenvalues of the Hankel DMD operator. A number of numerical examples illustrate the approach, including a study of the spectrum of the lid-driven two-dimensional cavity flow.},

Properties of the Koopman operator spectrum are linked to the sequence of flow regimes occurring between \$Re=10000\$ and \$Re=30000\$, and changing the flow nature from steady to aperiodic. The Koopman eigenfunctions for different flow regimes, including flows with mixed spectra, are constructed using the assumption of ergodicity in the state space. The associated Koopman modes show remarkable robustness even as the temporal nature of the flow is changing substantially.

	abstract = {Inference, prediction, and control of complex dynamical systems from time series is important in many areas, including financial markets, power grid management, climate and weather modeling, or molecular dynamics. The analysis of such highly nonlinear dynamical systems is facilitated by the fact that we can often find a (generally nonlinear) transformation of the system coordinates to features in which the dynamics can be excellently approximated by a linear Markovian model. Moreover, the large number of system variables often change collectively on large time- and length-scales, facilitating a low-dimensional analysis in feature space. In this paper, we introduce a variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) that allows us to find optimal feature mappings and optimal Markovian models of the dynamics from given time series data. The key insight is that the best linear model can be obtained from the top singular components of the Koopman operator. This leads to the definition of a family of score functions called VAMP-r which can be calculated from data, and can be employed to optimize a Markovian model. In addition, based on the relationship between the variational scores and approximation errors of Koopman operators, we propose a new VAMP-E score, which can be applied to cross-validation for hyper-parameter optimization and model selection in VAMP. VAMP is valid for both reversible and nonreversible processes and for stationary and nonstationary processes or realizations.},

	abstract = {Dimensionless numbers and scaling laws provide elegant insights into the characteristic properties of physical systems. Classical dimensional analysis and similitude theory fail to identify a set of unique dimensionless numbers for a highly multi-variable system with incomplete governing equations. This paper introduces a mechanistic data-driven approach that embeds the principle of dimensional invariance into a two-level machine learning scheme to automatically discover dominant dimensionless numbers and governing laws (including scaling laws and differential equations) from scarce measurement data. The proposed methodology, called dimensionless learning, is a physics-based dimension reduction technique. It can reduce high-dimensional parameter spaces to descriptions involving only a few physically interpretable dimensionless parameters, greatly simplifying complex process design and system optimization. We demonstrate the algorithm by solving several challenging engineering problems with noisy experimental measurements (not synthetic data) collected from the literature. Examples include turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection, vapor depression dynamics in laser melting of metals, and porosity formation in 3D printing. Lastly, we show that the proposed approach can identify dimensionally homogeneous differential equations with dimensionless number(s) by leveraging sparsity-promoting techniques.},

	abstract = {Global instability analysis of flows is often performed via time-stepping methods, based on the Arnoldi algorithm. When setting up these methods, several computational parameters must be chosen, which affect intrinsic errors of the procedure, such as the truncation errors, the discretization error of the flow solver, the error associated with the nonlinear terms of the Navier–Stokes equations and the error associated with the limited size of the approximation of the Jacobian matrix. This paper develops theoretical equations for the estimation of optimal balance between accuracy and cost for each case. The 2D open cavity flow is used both for explaining the effect of the parameters on the accuracy and the cost of the solution, and for verifying the quality of the predictions. The equations demonstrate the impact of each parameter on the quality of the solution. For example, if higher-order methods are used for approaching a Fréchet derivative in the procedure, it is shown that the solution deteriorates more rapidly for larger grids or less accurate flow solvers. On the other hand, lower-order approximations are more sensitive to the initial disturbance magnitude. Nevertheless, for accurate flow solvers and moderate grid dimensions, first-order Fréchet derivative approximation with optimal computational parameters can provide 5 decimal place accurate eigenvalues. It is further shown that optimal parameters based on accuracy tend to also lead to the most cost-effective solution. The predictive equations, guidelines and conclusions are general, and, in principle, applicable to any flow, including 3D ones.},

	abstract = {Many natural systems exhibit chaotic behavior, including the weather, hydrology, neuroscience, and population dynamics. Although many chaotic systems can be described by relatively simple dynamical equations, characterizing these systems can be challenging due to sensitivity to initial conditions and difficulties in differentiating chaotic behavior from noise. Ideally, one wishes to find a parsimonious set of equations that describe a dynamical system. However, model selection is more challenging when only a subset of the variables are experimentally accessible. Manifold learning methods using time-delay embeddings can successfully reconstruct the underlying structure of the system from data with hidden variables, but not the equations. Recent work in sparse-optimization based model selection has enabled model discovery given a library of possible terms, but regression-based methods require measurements of all state variables. We present a method combining variational annealing—a technique previously used for parameter estimation in chaotic systems with hidden variables—with sparse-optimization methods to perform model identification for chaotic systems with unmeasured variables. We applied the method to ground-truth time-series simulated from the classic Lorenz system and experimental data from an electrical circuit with Lorenz-system like behavior. In both cases, we successfully recover the expected equations with two measured and one hidden variable. Application to simulated data from the Colpitts oscillator demonstrates successful model selection of terms within nonlinear functions. We discuss the robustness of our method to varying noise.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of complex systems generally include high-dimensional, nonstationary, and nonlinear behavior, all of which pose fundamental challenges to quantitative understanding. To address these difficulties, we detail an approach based on local linear models within windows determined adaptively from data. While the dynamics within each window are simple, consisting of exponential decay, growth, and oscillations, the collection of local parameters across all windows provides a principled characterization of the full time series. To explore the resulting model space, we develop a likelihood-based hierarchical clustering, and we examine the eigenvalues of the linear dynamics. We demonstrate our analysis with the Lorenz system undergoing stable spiral dynamics and in the standard chaotic regime. Applied to the posture dynamics of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, our approach identifies fine-grained behavioral states and model dynamics which fluctuate about an instability boundary, and we detail a bifurcation in a transition from forward to backward crawling. We analyze whole-brain imaging in C. elegans and show that global brain dynamics is damped away from the instability boundary by a decrease in oxygen concentration. We provide additional evidence for such near-critical dynamics from the analysis of electrocorticography in monkey and the imaging of a neural population from mouse visual cortex at single-cell resolution.},

	title = {Network-theoretic modeling of fluid-structure interactions},
	abstract = {The coupling interactions between deformable structures and unsteady fluid flows occur across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales in many engineering applications. These fluid-structure interactions (FSI) make it challenging to predict flow physics accurately. In the present work, two multi-layer network approaches are proposed that characterize the interactions between the fluid and structural layers for an incompressible laminar flow over a two-dimensional compliant flat plate at a 35-degrees angle of attack. In one approach, the wake vortices and bound vortexlets form the nodes of the network with the edges defined by induced velocity. In the other approach, coherent structures (fluid modes) contributing to the kinetic energy of the flow and structural modes contributing to the kinetic energy of the compliant structure constitute the network nodes. The energy transfers between the modes are extracted using a perturbation approach. The network structure of the FSI system is further simplified using the community detection algorithm in the vortical approach and by selecting dominant modes in the modal approach. Network measures are used to reveal the temporal behavior of the individual nodes within the simplified FSI system. Predictive models are then built using both data-driven and physics-based methods. We conclude by investigating the controllability of the modal interaction network. This work sets the foundation for network-theoretic reduced-order modeling of fluid-structure interactions, generalizable to other multi-physics systems.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of system identification (ID) of linear and nonlinear non-autonomous systems from noisy and sparse data. We propose and analyze an objective function derived from a Bayesian formulation for learning a hidden Markov model with stochastic dynamics. We then analyze this objective function in the context of several state-of-the-art approaches for both linear and nonlinear system ID. In the former, we analyze least squares approaches for Markov parameter estimation, and in the latter, we analyze the multiple shooting approach. We demonstrate the limitations of the optimization problems posed by these existing methods by showing that they can be seen as special cases of the proposed optimization objective under certain simplifying assumptions: conditional independence of data and zero model error. Furthermore, we observe that our proposed approach has improved smoothness and inherent regularization that make it well-suited for system ID and provide mathematical explanations for these characteristics' origins. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate a mean squared error over 8.7 times lower compared to multiple shooting when data are noisy and/or sparse. Moreover, the proposed approach can identify accurate and generalizable models even when there are more parameters than data or when the underlying system exhibits chaotic behavior.},

Current and future applications have epic proportion: cars, trucks, trains, airplanes, wind turbines, medical devices, combustion, chemical reactors, just to name a few. Methods to adaptively adjust open-loop parameters are continually improving toward shorter response times. However, control design for in-time response is challenged by strong nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and time-delays. Recent advances in the field of model identification and system reduction, coupled with advances in control theory (robust, adaptive, and nonlinear) are driving significant progress in adaptive and in-time closed-loop control of fluid turbulence. In this review, we provide an overview of critical theoretical developments, highlighted by compelling experimental success stories. We also point to challenging open problems and propose potentially disruptive technologies of machine learning and compressive sensing.},

The goal of the control is to mitigate separation and early re-attachment. The forcing employs a spanwise array of active vortex generators. The flow state is monitored with skin-friction sensors downstream of the actuators. The feedback control law is obtained using model-free genetic programming control (GPC) (Gautier et al. in J Fluid Mech 770:442–457, 2015). The resulting flow is assessed using the momentum coefficient, pressure distribution and skin friction over the ramp and stereo PIV. The PIV yields vector field statistics, e.g. shear layer growth, the back-flow area and vortex region. GPC is benchmarked against the best periodic forcing. While open-loop control achieves separation reduction by locking-on the shedding mode, GPC gives rise to similar benefits by accelerating the shear layer growth. Moreover, GPC uses less actuation energy.},

Turbulent flow around a blunt-edged Ahmed body is examined at \$\$Re\_\{H\}{\textbackslash}approx 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}\$\$based on body height. The actuation is performed with pulsed jets at all trailing edges (multiple inputs) combined with a Coanda deflection surface. The flow is monitored with 16 pressure sensors distributed at the rear side (multiple outputs). We apply a recently developed model-free control strategy building on genetic programming in Dracopoulos and Kent (Neural Comput Appl 6:214–228, 1997) and Gautier et al. (J Fluid Mech 770:424–441, 2015). The optimized control laws comprise periodic forcing, multi-frequency forcing and sensor-based feedback including also time-history information feedback and combinations thereof. Key enabler is linear genetic programming (LGP) as powerful regression technique for optimizing the multiple-input multiple-output control laws. The proposed LGP control can select the best open- or closed-loop control in an unsupervised manner. Approximately 33\% base pressure recovery associated with 22\% drag reduction is achieved in all considered classes of control laws. Intriguingly, the feedback actuation emulates periodic high-frequency forcing. In addition, the control identified automatically the only sensor which listens to high-frequency flow components with good signal to noise ratio. Our control strategy is, in principle, applicable to all multiple actuators and sensors experiments.},

	abstract = {We experimentally optimize mixing of a turbulent round jet using machine learning
control (MLC) following Li et al (2017). The jet is manipulated with one unsteady minijet
blowing in wall-normal direction close to the nozzle exit. The flow is monitored with two
hotwire sensors. The first sensor is positioned on the centerline 5 jet diameters
downstream of the nozzle exit, i.e. the end of the potential core, while the second is
located 3 jet diameters downstream and displaced towards the shear-layer. The mixing
performance is monitored with mean velocity at the first sensor. A reduction of this
velocity correlates with increased entrainment near the potential core. MLC is
employed to optimize sensor feedback, a general open-loop broadband frequency
actuation and combinations of both. MLC has identified the optimal periodic forcing
with small duty cycle as the best control policy employing only 400 actuation
measurements, each lasting for 5 seconds. This learning rate is comparable if not
faster than typical optimization of periodic forcing with two free parameters (frequency
and duty cycle). In addition, MLC results indicate that neither new frequencies nor
sensor feedback improves mixing furtherâcontrary to many of other turbulence control
experiments. The optimality of pure periodic actuation may be attributed to the simple
jet flapping mechanism in the minijet plane. The performance of sensor feedback is
shown to face a challenge for small duty cycles. The jet mixing results demonstrate the
untapped potential of MLC in quickly learning optimal general control policies, even
deciding between open- and closed-loop control.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) plays an important role in the analysis of complex nonlinear systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), since it can describe the full-order system in a simplified but representative way using a handful of dominant dynamic modes. However, determining a POD from the results of complex unsteady simulations is often impractical using traditional approaches due to the need to store a large number of high-dimensional solutions. As an alternative, the incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been developed, which can be used to avoid the storage problem by performing the POD analysis on the fly using a single-pass updating algorithm. Nevertheless, the total computing cost of incremental SVD is more than traditional approaches. In order to reduce this total cost, we incorporate POD mode truncation into the incremental procedure, leading to an enhanced algorithm for incremental SVD. Two error estimators are formulated for this enhanced incremental SVD based on an aggregated expression of the snapshot solutions, equipping the proposed algorithm with criteria for choosing the truncation number. The effectiveness of these estimators and the parallel efficiency of the enhanced algorithm are demonstrated using transient solutions from representative model problems. Numerical results show that the enhanced algorithm can significantly improve the computing efficiency for different kinds of datasets, and that the proposed algorithm is scalable in both the strong and weak sense.},

Here we demonstrate that combining a data-driven methodology with some general physical principles enables discovery of a quantitatively accurate model of a non-equilibrium spatially extended system from high-dimensional data that is both noisy and incomplete. We illustrate this using an experimental weakly turbulent fluid flow where only the velocity field is accessible. We also show that this hybrid approach allows reconstruction of the inaccessible variables – the pressure and forcing field driving the flow.},

To illustrate this, we extract a system of governing equations describing flows of incompressible Newtonian fluids -- the Navier-Stokes equation, the continuity equation, and the boundary conditions -- from numerical data describing a highly turbulent channel flow in three dimensions. These relations have the familiar form of partial differential equations, which are easily interpretable and readily provide information about the relative importance of different physical effects as well as insight into the quality of the data, serving as a useful diagnostic tool. The approach described here is remarkably robust, yielding accurate results for very high noise levels, and should thus be well-suited to experimental data.},

	abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

PDE-Net 2.0 is a combination of numerical approximation of differential operators by convolutions and a symbolic multi-layer neural network for model recovery. Comparing with existing approaches, PDE-Net 2.0 has the most flexibility and expressive power by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model.

Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category.

To mitigate the impact of measurement noise, we also develop a weak formulation of SINDyCP and assess its performance on noisy data.

	abstract = {The filtering problems are derived from a sequential minimization of a quadratic function representing a compromise between model and data. In this paper, we use the Perron-Frobenius operator in stochastic process to develop a Perron-Frobenius operator filter. The proposed method belongs to Bayesian filtering and works for non-Gaussian distributions for nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. The recursion of the filtering can be characterized by the composition of Perron-Frobenius operator and likelihood operator. This gives a significant connection between the Perron-Frobenius operator and Bayesian filtering. We numerically fulfil the recursion through approximating the Perron-Frobenius operator by Ulam's method. In this way, the posterior measure is represented by a convex combination of the indicator functions in Ulam's method. To get a low rank approximation for the Perron-Frobenius operator filter, we take a spectral decomposition for the posterior measure by using the eigenfunctions of the discretized Perron-Frobenius operator. A convergence analysis is carried out and shows that the Perron-Frobenius operator filter achieves a higher convergence rate than the particle filter, which uses Dirac measures for the posterior. The proposed method is explored for the data assimilation of the stochastic dynamical systems. A few numerical examples are presented to illustrate the advantage of the Perron-Frobenius operator filter over particle filter and extend Kalman filter.},

This work reports the application of a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based flow control strategy to suppress perturbations evolving in the one-dimensional linearised Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equation and two-dimensional boundary layer flows. The former is commonly used to model the disturbance developing in flat-plate boundary layer flows. These flow systems are convectively unstable, being able to amplify the upstream disturbance, and are thus difficult to control. The control action is implemented through a volumetric force at a fixed position, and the control performance is evaluated by the reduction of perturbation amplitude downstream. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRL-based control in the KS system subjected to a random upstream noise. The amplitude of perturbation monitored downstream is reduced significantly, and the learnt policy is shown to be robust to both measurement and external noise. One of our focuses is to place sensors optimally in the DRL control using the gradient-free particle swarm optimisation algorithm. After the optimisation process for different numbers of sensors, a specific eight-sensor placement is found to yield the best control performance. The optimised sensor placement in the KS equation is applied directly to control two-dimensional Blasius boundary layer flows, and can efficiently reduce the downstream perturbation energy. Via flow analyses, the control mechanism found by DRL is the opposition control. Besides, it is found that when the flow instability information is embedded in the reward function of DRL to penalise the instability, the control performance can be further improved in this convectively unstable flow.},

Flow transitions are an important fluid-dynamic phenomena for many reasons, including the direct effect on the aerodynamic forces acting on the body. In the present study, two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) wake transitions of a NACA0012 airfoil are studied for angles of attack in the range 0∘≤𝛼≤20∘0∘≤α≤20∘0{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}leq 20{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ and Reynolds numbers 500≤Re≤5000500≤Re≤5000500 {\textbackslash}leq \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\} {\textbackslash}leq 5000. The study uses water-channel experiments and 2-D and 3-D numerical simulations based on the nodal spectral-element method, level-set function-based immersed-interface method and Floquet stability analysis. The different wake states are categorised based on the time-instantaneous wake structure, non-dimensional frequency and aerodynamic force coefficients. The wake states and transition boundaries are summarised in a wake regime map. The critical angle of attack and Reynolds number for the supercritical Hopf bifurcation (i.e. steady to periodic wake transition) varies as 𝛼1∼Re−0.65α1∼Re−0.65{\textbackslash}alpha \_1 \{{\textbackslash}sim\} \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-0.65\}, while the critical angle of attack for the onset of three dimensionality varies as 𝛼3𝐷∼Re−0.5α3D∼Re−0.5{\textbackslash}alpha \_\{3D\} \{{\textbackslash}sim\} \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-0.5\}. Over the entire Reynolds number range, the transition to 3-D flow occurs through a mode C (subharmonic) transition. Beyond this initial transition, further instabilities of the 2-D periodic base flow arise and are investigated. For instance, at Re=2000Re=2000 \{{\textbackslash}textit \{Re\}\}=2000 and 𝛼3𝐷,2=11.0∘α3D,2=11.0∘{\textbackslash}alpha \_\{3D,2\}=11.0{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ, mode C coexists together with modes related to modes A and QP seen in a stationary circular cylinder wake.

Three-dimensional simulations well beyond critical angles indicate that 2-D vortex-street transitions are approximately maintained in the fully saturated 3-D wakes in a spanwise-averaged sense.},

Data-driven dimensionality reduction methods such as proper orthogonal decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition have proven to be useful for exploring complex phenomena within fluid dynamics and beyond. A well-known challenge for these techniques is posed by the continuous symmetries, e.g. translations and rotations, of the system under consideration, as drifts in the data dominate the modal expansions without providing an insight into the dynamics of the problem. In the present study, we address this issue for fluid flows in rectangular channels by formulating a continuous symmetry reduction method that eliminates the translations in the streamwise and spanwise directions simultaneously. We demonstrate our method by computing the symmetry-reduced dynamic mode decomposition (SRDMD) of sliding windows of data obtained from the transitional plane-Couette and turbulent plane-Poiseuille flow simulations. In the former setting, SRDMD captures the dynamics in the vicinity of the invariant solutions with translation symmetries, i.e. travelling waves and relative periodic orbits, whereas in the latter, our calculations reveal episodes of turbulent time evolution that can be approximated by a low-dimensional linear expansion.},

	abstract = {, Turbulence is a complex nonlinear and multi-scale phenomenon. Although the fundamental underlying equations, the Navier–Stokes equations, have been known for two centuries, it remains extremely challenging to extract from them the statistical properties of turbulence. Therefore, for practical purposes, a sustained effort has been devoted to obtaining an effective description of turbulence, that we may call turbulence modelling, or statistical theory of turbulence. In this respect, the renormalisation group (RG) appears as a tool of choice, since it is precisely designed to provide effective theories from fundamental equations by performing in a systematic way the average over fluctuations. However, for Navier–Stokes turbulence, a suitable framework for the RG, allowing in particular for non-perturbative approximations, has been missing, which has thwarted RG applications for a long time. This framework is provided by the modern formulation of the RG called the functional renormalisation group (FRG). The use of the FRG has enabled important progress in the theoretical understanding of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The major one is the rigorous derivation, from the Navier–Stokes equations, of an analytical expression for any Eulerian multi-point multi-time correlation function, which is exact in the limit of large wavenumbers. We propose in this JFM Perspectives article a survey of the FRG method for turbulence. We provide a basic introduction to the FRG and emphasise how the field-theoretical framework allows one to systematically and profoundly exploit the symmetries. We stress that the FRG enables one to describe fully developed turbulence forced at large scales, which was not accessible by perturbative means. We show that it yields the energy spectrum and second-order structure function with accurate estimates of the related constants, and also the behaviour of the spectrum in the near-dissipative range. Finally, we expound the derivation of the spatio-temporal behaviour of 𝑛nn-point correlation functions, and largely illustrate these results through the analysis of data from experiments and direct numerical simulations.},

Specifically, we assess various DMD variants and test their sensitivity to the POD rank truncation, the sampling rate, and the time window. A critical enabler to our analysis is a new presentation of the DMD algorithm as a modular framework consisting of five distinct steps. The test results show a high sensitivity to rank truncation and a low sensitivity to the time window selection when a reasonable time period is used. The tests also highlight the existing dangers of aliasing, when the sampling rate is too low.

	abstract = {Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX\_c, X\_{\textbackslash}baro, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

Gene expression programming uses character linear chromosomes composed of genes structurally organized in a head and a tail. The chromosomes function as a genome and are subjected to modification by means of mutation, transposition, root transposition, gene transposition, gene recombination, and one- and two-point recombination. The chromosomes encode expression trees which are the object of selection. The creation of these separate entities (genome and expression tree) with distinct functions allows the algorithm to perform with high efficiency that greatly surpasses existing adaptive techniques. The suite of problems chosen to illustrate the power and versatility of gene expression programming includes symbolic regression, sequence induction with and without constant creation, block stacking, cellular automata rules for the density-classification problem, and two problems of boolean concept learning: the 11-multiplexer and the GP rule problem.},

Our model is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of challenging chaotic and turbulent dynamics at low resolution, including trajectories generated by the state-of-the-art Athena++ engine. We show that our simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized, turbulence-specific architectures from the learned turbulence simulation literature. In general, we see that learned simulators yield unstable trajectories; however, we show that tuning training noise and temporal downsampling solves this problem. We also find that while generalization beyond the training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise, added loss constraints, and dataset augmentation can help. Broadly, we conclude that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on coarser grids, and emphasize that simple design choices can offer stability and robust generalization.},

In this work, we demonstrate symbolic regression can complement flexible models by distilling the posterior predictive distribution of such flexible models into interpretable analytic expressions. We recover common GW population models such as a power-law-plus-Gaussian, and find a new empirical population model which combines accuracy and simplicity. This demonstrates a strategy to automatically discover interpretable population models in the ever-growing GW catalog, which can potentially be applied to other astrophysical phenomena.},

In this method, candidate expressions generated by evolutionary algorithms are transformed between the GEP and ANN structures during training iterations, and efficient and robust convergence to accurate models is achieved by combining the GEP's global searching and the ANN's gradient optimization capabilities. In addition, sparsity-enhancing strategies have been introduced to GEPNN to improve the interpretability of the trained models. The GEPNN method has been tested for finding different physical laws, showing improved convergence to models with precise coefficients. Furthermore, for large-eddy simulation of turbulence, the subgrid-scale stress model trained by GEPNN significantly improves the prediction of turbulence statistics and flow structures over traditional models, showing advantages compared to the existing GEP and ANN methods in both a priori and a posteriori tests.},

In the present study, particles settle under gravity in an unbounded viscous fluid. At sufficient mass loadings, interphase momentum exchange between the phases results in the spontaneous generation of particle clusters that sustain velocity fluctuations in the fluid. Data generated from Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations are used in a sparse regression method for model closure that ensures form invariance. Particular attention is paid to modelling the unclosed terms unique to the multiphase RANS equations (drag production, drag exchange, pressure strain and viscous dissipation). A minimal set of tensors is presented that serve as the basis for modelling. It is found that sparse regression identifies compact, algebraic models that are accurate across flow conditions and robust to sparse training data.},

The machine-learning method is based on elastic net regularisation which promotes sparsity of the inferred models.

Model-discovery and cross-validation is performed for three cases of separating flows, i.e. periodic hills (Re=10595), converging-diverging channel (Re=12600) and curved backward-facing step (Re=13700). The predictions of the discovered models are significantly improved over the k-ω SST also for a true prediction of the flow over periodic hills at Re=37000.

	abstract = {Although generalized cross-validation is a popular tool for calculating a regularization parameter, it has been rarely applied to large-scale problems until recently. A major difficulty lies in the evaluation of the cross-validation function that requires the calculation of the trace of an inverse matrix. In the last few years stochastic trace estimators have been proposed to alleviate this problem. This article demonstrates numerical approximation techniques that further reduce the computational complexity. The new approach employs Gauss quadrature to compute lower and upper bounds on the cross-validation function. It only requires the operator form of the system matrix—that is, a subroutine to evaluate matrix-vector products. Thus, the factorization of large matrices can be avoided. The new approach has been implemented in MATLAB. Numerical experiments confirm the remarkable accuracy of the stochastic trace estimator. Regularization parameters are computed for ill-posed problems with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 unknowns.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in model selection and the appraisal of psychological theory. The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.

However, resolvent modes are frequency-dependent, which, although responsible for their success in identifying scale interactions in turbulence, complicates their use for control purposes. In this work, we seek orthogonal bases of forcing and response modes that are the most responsive and receptive, respectively, across all frequencies. We show that these frequency-independent bases of {\textbackslash}emph\{representative\} resolvent modes are given by the eigenvectors of the observability and controllability Gramians of the system considering full state inputs and outputs. We present several numerical examples where we leverage these bases by building orthogonal or interpolatory projectors onto the dominant forcing and response subspaces. Gramian-based forcing modes are used to identify dynamically relevant disturbances, to place point sensors to measure disturbances, and to design actuators for feedforward control in the subcritical linearized Ginzburg--Landau equation. Gramian-based response modes are used to identify coherent structures and for point sensor placement aiming at state reconstruction in the turbulent flow in a minimal channel at \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Re\}\_\{{\textbackslash}tau\}=185\$. The approach does not require data snapshots and relies only on knowledge of the steady or mean flow.},

However, the control of false discoveries for sparse model identification is challenging, especially in the low-data and high-noise limit. In this paper, we perform a theoretical study on ensemble sparse model discovery, which shows empirical success in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise. In particular, we analyse the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares estimator. We show that this bootstrapping-based ensembling technique can perform a provably correct variable selection procedure with an exponential convergence rate of the error rate. In addition, we show that the ensemble sparse model discovery method can perform computationally efficient uncertainty estimation, compared to expensive Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods via MCMC. We demonstrate the convergence properties and connection to uncertainty quantification in various numerical studies on synthetic sparse linear regression and sparse model discovery. The experiments on sparse linear regression support that the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method has better performance for sparse variable selection compared to LASSO, thresholding least-squares, and bootstrapping-based LASSO. In the sparse model discovery experiment, we show that the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method can provide valid uncertainty quantification, converging to a delta measure centered around the true value with increased sample sizes. Finally, we highlight the improved robustness to hyperparameter selection under shifting noise and sparsity levels of the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method compared to other sparse regression methods.},

Downstream tasks from sensing include inferring full state estimates of a system (system identification), control decisions, and forecasting. These tasks are exceptionally challenging to achieve with limited sensors, noisy measurements, and corrupt or missing data. Existing techniques typically use current (static) sensor measurements to perform such tasks and require principled sensor placement or an abundance of randomly placed sensors. In contrast, we propose a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED) neural network structure which incorporates (i) a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to learn a latent representation of the temporal dynamics of the sensors, and (ii) a shallow decoder that learns a mapping between this latent representation and the high-dimensional state space. By explicitly accounting for the time-history, or trajectory, of the sensor measurements, SHRED enables accurate reconstructions with far fewer sensors, outperforms existing techniques when more measurements are available, and is agnostic towards sensor placement. In addition, a compressed representation of the high-dimensional state is directly obtained from sensor measurements, which provides an on-the-fly compression for modeling physical and engineering systems. Forecasting is also achieved from the sensor time-series data alone, producing an efficient paradigm for predicting temporal evolution with an exceptionally limited number of sensors. In the example cases explored, including turbulent flows, complex spatio-temporal dynamics can be characterized with exceedingly limited sensors that can be randomly placed with minimal loss of performance.},

	abstract = {In many industrial applications, obtaining labeled observations is not straightforward as it often requires the intervention of human experts or the use of expensive testing equipment. In these circumstances, active learning can be highly beneficial in suggesting the most informative data points to be used when fitting a model. Reducing the number of observations needed for model development alleviates both the computational burden required for training and the operational expenses related to labeling. Online active learning, in particular, is useful in high-volume production processes where the decision about the acquisition of the label for a data point needs to be taken within an extremely short time frame. However, despite the recent efforts to develop online active learning strategies, the behavior of these methods in the presence of outliers has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we investigate the performance of online active linear regression in contaminated data streams. Our study shows that the currently available query strategies are prone to sample outliers, whose inclusion in the training set eventually degrades the predictive performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a solution that bounds the search area of a conditional D-optimal algorithm and uses a robust estimator. Our approach strikes a balance between exploring unseen regions of the input space and protecting against outliers. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method is effective in improving the performance of online active learning in the presence of outliers, thus expanding the potential applications of this powerful tool.},

The investigation covers both large and small sample sizes. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that SBC has relatively better performance in lag-choice accuracy in many situations. It is also generally the least sensitive to ARCH regardless of stability or instability of the VAR model, especially in large sample sizes. These appealing properties of SBC make it the optimal criterion for choosing lag length in many situations, especially in the case of financial data, which are usually characterized by occasional periods of high volatility. SBC also has the best forecasting abilities in the majority of situations in which we vary sample size, stability, variance structure (ARCH or not), and forecast horizon (one period or five). frequently, AICC also has good lag-choosing and forecasting properties. However, when ARCH is present, the five-period forecast performance of all criteria in all situations worsens.},

An important utility of DMD is the compact and reduced-order spectral representation of observations in terms of the DMD eigenvalues and modes, where the temporal information is separated from the spatial information. From a spatiotemporal viewpoint, we show that when DMD is applied to delay-coordinates embedding, temporal information is intertwined with spatial information, inducing a particular spectral structure on the DMD components. We formulate and analyze this structure, which we term the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD. Based on this spatiotemporal coupling, we propose a new method for DMD components selection. When using delay-coordinates DMD that comprises redundant modes, this selection is an essential step for obtaining a compact and reduced-order representation of the observations. We demonstrate our method on noisy simulated signals and various dynamical systems and show superior component selection compared to a commonly-used method that relies on the amplitudes of the modes.},

We outline a collection of existing methods for selecting embedding lag in both uniform and non-uniform delay embedding cases. Highlighting the poor dynamical explainability of existing methods of selecting non-uniform lags, we provide an alternative method of selecting embedding lags that includes a mixture of both dynamical and topological arguments. The proposed method, \{{\textbackslash}em Significant Times on Persistent Strands\} (SToPS), uses persistent homology to construct a characteristic time spectrum that quantifies the relative dynamical significance of each time lag.

	shorttitle = {Beyond optimal disturbances},
	abstract = {The theory of transient growth describes how linear mechanisms can cause temporary amplification of disturbances even when the linearized system is asymptotically stable as defined by its eigenvalues. This growth is traditionally quantified by finding the initial disturbance that generates the maximum response, in terms of energy gain, at the peak time of its evolution. While this bounds the growth, it can vastly overstate the growth of a real disturbance. In this paper, we introduce a statistical perspective on transient growth that models statistics of the energy amplification of the disturbances. We derive a formula for the mean energy amplification in terms of the two-point spatial correlation of the initial disturbance. We also derive an accurate approximation of the probability density function of the energy of the growing disturbance, from which confidence bounds on the growth can be obtained. Applying our analysis to Poisseuille flow yields a number of observations. First, the mean gain can be drastically smaller than the maximum, especially when the disturbances are broadband in wavenumber content. In these cases, it is exceedingly unlikely to achieve near-optimal growth due to the exponential behavior which we observe in the probability density function. Second, the characteristic length scale of the initial disturbances has a significant impact on the expected growth; specifically, large-scale initial disturbances produce orders-of-magnitude-larger expected growth than smaller scales, indicating that the length scale of incoming disturbances may be key in determining whether transient growth leads to transition for a particular flow. Finally, while the optimal growth scales quadratically with Reynolds number, we observe that the mean energy amplification scales only linearly for certain reasonable choices of the initial correlations.},

Since rank minimization is generally not practicable owing to its integer nature, we propose a real-valued extension that we term effective rank. After proving some of its properties, the effective rank is provided with an operational meaning using a result on the coefﬁcient rate of a stationary random process.

	title = {Curriculum learning for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems},
	abstract = {The reliable prediction of the temporal behavior of complex systems is key in numerous scientific fields. This strong interest is however hindered by modeling issues: often, the governing equations describing the physics of the system under consideration are not accessible or, if known, their solution might require a computational time incompatible with the prediction time constraints. Not surprisingly, approximating complex systems in a generic functional format and informing it ex-nihilo from available observations has become common practice in the age of machine learning, as illustrated by the numerous successful examples based on deep neural networks. However, generalizability of the models, margins of guarantee and the impact of data are often overlooked or examined mainly by relying on prior knowledge of the physics. We tackle these issues from a different viewpoint, by adopting a curriculum learning strategy. In curriculum learning, the dataset is structured such that the training process starts from simple samples towards more complex ones in order to favor convergence and generalization. The concept has been developed and successfully applied in robotics and control of systems. Here, we apply this concept for the learning of complex dynamical systems in a systematic way. First, leveraging insights from the ergodic theory, we assess the amount of data sufficient for a-priori guaranteeing a faithful model of the physical system and thoroughly investigate the impact of the training set and its structure on the quality of long-term predictions. Based on that, we consider entropy as a metric of complexity of the dataset; we show how an informed design of the training set based on the analysis of the entropy significantly improves the resulting models in terms of generalizability, and provide insights on the amount and the choice of data required for an effective data-driven modeling.},

First, we review the general framework of the model-free control problem, bringing together all methods as black-box optimization problems. Then, we test the control algorithms on three test cases. These are (1) the stabilization of a nonlinear dynamical system featuring frequency cross-talk, (2) the wave cancellation from a Burgers' flow and (3) the drag reduction in a cylinder wake flow. We present a comprehensive comparison to illustrate their differences in exploration versus exploitation and their balance between `model capacity' in the control law definition versus `required complexity'. We believe that such a comparison paves the way toward the hybridization of the various methods, and we offer some perspective on their future development in the literature on flow control problems.},

Symmetry arguments provide a way to study these collective behaviors and to simplify their analysis. The Koopman operator is an in nite dimensional linear operator that fully captures a system’s nonlinear dynamics through the linear evolution of functions of the state space. Importantly, in contrast with local linearization, it preserves a system’s global nonlinear features. We demonstrate how the presence of symmetries a ects the Koopman operator structure and its spectral properties. In fact, we show that symmetry considerations can also simplify nding the Koopman operator approximations using the extended and kernel dynamic mode decomposition methods (EDMD and kernel DMD). Speci cally, representation theory allows us to demonstrate that an isotypic component basis induces a block diagonal structure in operator approximations, revealing hidden organization. Practically, if the symmetries are known, the EDMD and kernel DMD methods can be modi ed to give more e cient computation of the Koopman operator approximation and its eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and eigenmodes. Rounding out the development, we discuss the e ect of measurement noise.},

	title = {Data-driven discovery of {Koopman} eigenfunctions for control},
	abstract = {Data-driven transformations that reformulate nonlinear systems in a linear framework have the potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of strongly nonlinear dynamics using linear systems theory. The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Previous studies have used finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator for model-predictive control approaches. In this work, we illustrate a fundamental closure issue of this approach and argue that it is beneficial to first validate eigenfunctions and then construct reduced-order models in these validated eigenfunctions. These coordinates form a Koopman-invariant subspace by design and, thus, have improved predictive power. We show then how the control can be formulated directly in these intrinsic coordinates and discuss potential benefits and caveats of this perspective. The resulting control architecture is termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear Identification and Control (KRONIC). It is demonstrated that these eigenfunctions can be approximated with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the partial differential equation governing the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. Validating discovered eigenfunctions is crucial and we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be faithfully extracted from EDMD or an implicit formulation. These lightly damped eigenfunctions are particularly relevant for control, as they correspond to nearly conserved quantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such as the Hamiltonian. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant examples, including 1) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, 2) a variety of Hamiltonian systems, and 3) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for ocean mixing.},

It is flexible and easy to use with any pre-existing DMD-type method, and with different types of data. We prove convergence of \${\textbackslash}texttt\{mpEDMD\}\$ for projection-valued and scalar-valued spectral measures, spectra, and Koopman mode decompositions. For the case of delay embedding (Krylov subspaces), our results include the first convergence rates of the approximation of spectral measures as the size of the dictionary increases.

We formalize a framework to learn the Koopman operator from ﬁnite data trajectories of the dynamical system. We consider the restriction of this operator to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and introduce a notion of risk, from which different estimators naturally arise. We link the risk with the estimation of the spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator. These observations motivate a reduced-rank operator regression (RRR) estimator. We derive learning bounds for the proposed estimator, holding both in i.i.d. and non i.i.d. settings, the latter in terms of mixing coefﬁcients.

We focus on time-reversal-invariant Markov chains, implying that the Koopman operator is self-adjoint. This includes important examples of stochastic dynamical systems, notably Langevin dynamics. Our spectral learning bounds are driven by the simultaneous control of the operator norm risk of the estimators and a metric distortion associated to the corresponding eigenfunctions. Our analysis indicates that both algorithms have similar variance, but EDMD suffers from a larger bias which might be detrimental to its learning rate. We further argue that a large metric distortion may lead to spurious eigenvalues, a phenomenon which has been empirically observed, and note that metric distortion can be estimated from data. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical findings.},

In this paper, we propose subspace DMD as an algorithm for the Koopman analysis of random dynamical systems with observation noise. Subspace DMD first computes the orthogonal projection of future snapshots to the space of past snapshots and then estimates the spectra of a linear model, and its output converges to the spectra of the stochastic Koopman operator under standard assumptions. We investigate the empirical performance of subspace DMD with several dynamical systems and show its utility for the Koopman analysis of random dynamical systems.},

The learning framework can extract spectral information from the full nonlinear dynamics by learning the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the associated Koopman operator. We then exploit the learned Koopman eigenfunctions to learn a lifted linear statespace model. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the ﬁrst to utilize Koopman eigenfunctions as lifting functions for EDMD-based methods. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in state prediction and closed loop trajectory tracking of a simulated cart pole system.

Here, we construct maximally predictive states by concatenating measurements in time, partitioning the resulting sequences using maximum entropy, and choosing the sequence length to maximize short-time predictive information. Transitions between these states yield a simple approximation of the transfer operator, which we use to reveal timescale separation and long-lived collective modes through the operator spectrum. Applicable to both deterministic and stochastic processes, we illustrate our approach through partial observations of the Lorenz system and the stochastic dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential. We use our transfer operator approach to provide a new estimator of the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy, which we demonstrate in discrete and continuous-time systems, as well as the movement behavior of the nematode worm C. elegans.},

	abstract = {We study the transport and mixing properties of flows in a variety of settings, connecting the classical geometrical approach via invariant manifolds with a probabilistic approach via transfer operators. For non-divergent fluid-like flows, we demonstrate that eigenvectors of numerical transfer operators efficiently decompose the domain into invariant regions. For dissipative chaotic flows such a decomposition into invariant regions does not exist; instead, the transfer operator approach detects almost-invariant sets. We demonstrate numerically that the boundaries of these almost-invariant regions are predominantly comprised of segments of co-dimension 1 invariant manifolds. For a mixing periodically driven fluid-like flow we show that while sets bounded by stable and unstable manifolds are almost-invariant, the transfer operator approach can identify almost-invariant sets with smaller mass leakage. Thus the transport mechanism of lobe dynamics need not correspond to minimal transport. The transfer operator approach is purely probabilistic; it directly determines those regions that minimally mix with their surroundings. The almost-invariant regions are identified via eigenvectors of a transfer operator and are ranked by the corresponding eigenvalues in the order of the sets’ invariance or “leakiness”. While we demonstrate that the almost-invariant sets are often bounded by segments of invariant manifolds, without such a ranking it is not at all clear which intersections of invariant manifolds form the major barriers to mixing. Furthermore, in some cases invariant manifolds do not bound sets of minimal leakage. Our transfer operator constructions are very simple and fast to implement; they require a sample of short trajectories, followed by eigenvector calculations of a sparse matrix.},

Although flow-field representations can be very high-dimensional, their dynamics can have low-order representations and may be estimated using a few, appropriately placed measurements. This paper presents a sensor-selection framework for the intended application of data-driven, flow-field estimation. This framework combines data-driven modeling, steady-state Kalman Filter design, and a sparsification technique for sequential selection of sensors. This paper also uses the sensor selection framework to design sensor arrays that can perform well across a variety of operating conditions. Flow estimation results on numerical data show that the proposed framework produces arrays that are highly effective at flow-field estimation for the flow behind and an airfoil at a high angle of attack using embedded pressure sensors. Analysis of the flow fields reveals that paths of impinging stagnation points along the airfoil's surface during a shedding period of the flow are highly informative locations for placement of pressure sensors.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Weak-form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) method for estimating model parameters for non-linear systems of ODEs. The core mathematical idea involves an efficient conversion of the strong form representation of a model to its weak form, and then solving a regression problem to perform parameter inference. The core statistical idea rests on the Errors-In-Variables framework, which necessitates the use of the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. Further improvements are obtained by using orthonormal test functions, created from a set of \$C{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ bump functions of varying support sizes. We demonstrate that WENDy is a highly robust and efficient method for parameter inference in differential equations. Without relying on any numerical differential equation solvers, WENDy computes accurate estimates and is robust to large (biologically relevant) levels of measurement noise. For low dimensional systems with modest amounts of data, WENDy is competitive with conventional forward solver-based nonlinear least squares methods in terms of speed and accuracy. For both higher dimensional systems and stiff systems, WENDy is typically both faster (often by orders of magnitude) and more accurate than forward solver-based approaches. We illustrate the method and its performance in some common population and neuroscience models, including logistic growth, Lotka-Volterra, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Hindmarsh-Rose, and a Protein Transduction Benchmark model. Software and code for reproducing the examples is available at (https://github.com/MathBioCU/WENDy).},

	abstract = {Predictive simulations are essential for applications ranging from weather forecasting to material design. The veracity of these simulations hinges on their capacity to capture the effective system dynamics. Massively parallel simulations predict the systems dynamics by resolving all spatiotemporal scales, often at a cost that prevents experimentation. On the other hand, reduced order models are fast but often limited by the linearization of the system dynamics and the adopted heuristic closures. We propose a novel systematic framework that bridges large scale simulations and reduced order models to extract and forecast adaptively the effective dynamics (AdaLED) of multiscale systems. AdaLED employs an autoencoder to identify reduced-order representations of the system dynamics and an ensemble of probabilistic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the latent time-stepper. The framework alternates between the computational solver and the surrogate, accelerating learned dynamics while leaving yet-to-be-learned dynamics regimes to the original solver. AdaLED continuously adapts the surrogate to the new dynamics through online training. The transitions between the surrogate and the computational solver are determined by monitoring the prediction accuracy and uncertainty of the surrogate. The effectiveness of AdaLED is demonstrated on three different systems - a Van der Pol oscillator, a 2D reaction-diffusion equation, and a 2D Navier-Stokes flow past a cylinder for varying Reynolds numbers (400 up to 1200), showcasing its ability to learn effective dynamics online, detect unseen dynamics regimes, and provide net speed-ups. To the best of our knowledge, AdaLED is the first framework that couples a surrogate model with a computational solver to achieve online adaptive learning of effective dynamics. It constitutes a potent tool for applications requiring many expensive simulations.},

The instability mechanism behind a geometrically simple cylindrical roughness element continues to be a challenging topic in fluid mechanics. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the phenomena in recent years, but more research is needed to predict the temporal nature and spatial structure of the dominant instability in a given flow configuration. This is of particular interest, as these instabilities dictate the transition to turbulence and thus are significant for large-scale effects such as skin friction drag. A smoke-flow visualization study with a large variation of parameters, featuring a cylindrical roughness element connected to a linear traverse, has been performed. Results show good agreement with previous investigations and provide further insights into the stability properties, revealing several unexpected effects. For a low roughness aspect ratio 𝜂η{\textbackslash}eta, no global instability is detected even at the highest roughness Reynolds number 𝑅𝑒𝑘𝑘RekkRe\_\{kk\}, whereas a high aspect ratio indicates a delay in the onset of instability. From the acquired visualizations, we constructed the, so far, richest instability diagram of the wake behind an isolated roughness element in the 𝑅𝑒𝑘𝑘–𝜂Rekk–ηRe\_\{kk\}{\textbackslash}unicode\{x2013\}{\textbackslash}eta space, sampled in the same measurement campaign. Furthermore, information regarding the dominant frequency in the wake can be extracted from the visualization images. Our results suggest a new scaling of the frequency as the velocity is increased. Finally, it is shown that the dominant frequency in a certain flow regime can be well predicted using a Strouhal number based on the cylinder diameter and the roughness velocity.},

In this work, a robust and “tune-free” sampler is proposed to extend one of the sequential Monte Carlo implementations for the identification of time-varying parameters which can be assumed constant within each set of data collected but might vary across different sequences of datasets. The proposed approach involves the implementation of the affine-invariant Ensemble sampler in place of the Metropolis–Hastings sampler to update the samples. An adaptive-tuning algorithm is also proposed to automatically tune the step-size of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler which, in turn, controls the acceptance rate of the samples across iterations. Furthermore, a numerical investigation behind the existence of inherent lower and upper bounds on the acceptance rate, making the algorithm robust by design, is also conducted. The proposed method allows for the off-line and on-line identification of the most probable models under uncertainty. The proposed sampling strategy is first verified against the existing sequential Monte Carlo sampler in a numerical example. Then, it is validated by identifying the time-varying parameters and the most probable model of a nonlinear dynamical system using experimental data.},

	abstract = {Rayleigh-B{\textbackslash}'enard convection (RBC) is a recurrent phenomenon in several industrial and geoscience flows and a well-studied system from a fundamental fluid-mechanics viewpoint. However, controlling RBC, for example by modulating the spatial distribution of the bottom-plate heating in the canonical RBC configuration, remains a challenging topic for classical control-theory methods. In the present work, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for controlling RBC. We show that effective RBC control can be obtained by leveraging invariant multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which takes advantage of the locality and translational invariance inherent to RBC flows inside wide channels. The MARL framework applied to RBC allows for an increase in the number of control segments without encountering the curse of dimensionality that would result from a naive increase in the DRL action-size dimension. This is made possible by the MARL ability for re-using the knowledge generated in different parts of the RBC domain. We show in a case study that MARL DRL is able to discover an advanced control strategy that destabilizes the spontaneous RBC double-cell pattern, changes the topology of RBC by coalescing adjacent convection cells, and actively controls the resulting coalesced cell to bring it to a new stable configuration. This modified flow configuration results in reduced convective heat transfer, which is beneficial in several industrial processes. Therefore, our work both shows the potential of MARL DRL for controlling large RBC systems, as well as demonstrates the possibility for DRL to discover strategies that move the RBC configuration between different topological configurations, yielding desirable heat-transfer characteristics. These results are useful for both gaining further understanding of the intrinsic properties of RBC, as well as for developing industrial applications.},

	abstract = {Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) provide a powerful approach to compute time-varying analogs of invariant manifolds in unsteady fluid flow fields. These manifolds are useful to visualize the transport mechanisms of passive tracers advecting with the flow. However, many vehicles and mobile sensors are not passive, but are instead actuated according to some intelligent trajectory planning or control law; for example, model predictive control and reinforcement learning are often used to design energy-efficient trajectories in a dynamically changing background flow. In this work, we investigate the use of FTLE on such controlled agents to gain insight into optimal transport routes for navigation in known unsteady flows. We find that these controlled FTLE (cFTLE) coherent structures separate the flow field into different regions with similar costs of transport to the goal location. These separatrices are functions of the planning algorithm's hyper-parameters, such as the optimization time horizon and the cost of actuation. Computing the invariant sets and manifolds of active agent dynamics in dynamic flow fields is useful in the context of robust motion control, hyperparameter tuning, and determining safe and collision-free trajectories for autonomous systems. Moreover, these cFTLE structures provide insight into effective deployment locations for mobile agents with actuation and energy constraints to traverse the ocean or atmosphere.},

	abstract = {There is a growing need for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to operate in cities. However, the uneven urban landscape and complex street systems cause large-scale wind gusts that challenge the safe and effective operation of UAVs. Current gust alleviation methods rely on traditional control surfaces and computationally expensive modeling to select a control action, leading to a slower response. Here, we used deep reinforcement learning to create an autonomous gust alleviation controller for a camber-morphing wing. This method reduced gust impact by 84\%, directly from real-time, on-board pressure signals. Notably, we found that gust alleviation using signals from only three pressure taps was statistically indistinguishable from using six signals. This reduced-sensor fly-by-feel control opens the door to UAV missions in previously inoperable locations.},

	abstract = {This study extends the input-output framework for the receptivity analysis of an incompressible boundary layer introduced by Ran et al. [Phys. Rev. Fluids 4, 093901 (2019)] to the laminar adiabatic supersonic case. Spatially distributed in the wall-normal direction, a δ-correlated Gaussian noise is considered as input, both including the velocity and temperature fields. Similarly, components of the resulting velocity and/or temperature fields are chosen as outputs. To study effects on the boundary layer, the measurements of the output are restricted within the δ99 boundary layer thickness, implying, however, that effects like acoustic radiation to the free stream are outside the scope of the present analysis. The main goal of the study is twofold: first, to demonstrate the potential of the chosen approach by comparison with familiar results, and second, to extend the current state of knowledge in the compressible regime in selected points by exploiting the extended capabilities of the chosen framework. To this end, the importance of the different inputs—especially the temperature effects—for the amplification of two-dimensional, oblique flow structures and streaks are discussed. Furthermore, the influence of first and second Mach modes (not present in the incompressible regime) is identified within the stochastic framework and results are discussed in light of previous receptivity analyses where the output is restricted to a single mode. By varying the spatial distribution of the forcing, the dependence of the receptivity on the wall-normal position, where the forcing is introduced, is illustrated and discussed. Finally, dominant coherent structures are identified by evaluating the first singular vector of the correlation matrix (proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes). By analyzing the dependence of both forcing and response POD modes on the choice of the measured component, further insight is provided about the contribution of temperature fluctuation to the stochastically maintained variance of the system.},

Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models.},

As a result, a mismatch occurs between the predicted trajectories of the original system and the truncated one. We put forth a framework to apply a continuous time control signal in the latent space of the reduced order model (ROM) to account for the effect of truncation. We set the control input using parameterized models by following energy transfer principles. Our methodology relies on observing the system behavior in the physical space and using the projection operator to restrict the feedback signal into the latent space. Then, we leverage the forward sensitivity method (FSM) to derive relationships between the feedback and the desired mode-dependent control. We test the performance of the proposed approach using two test cases, corresponding to viscous Burgers and vortex merger problems at high Reynolds number. Results show that the ROM trajectory with the applied FSM control closely matches its target values in both the data-dense and data-sparse regimes.},

This approach is a valuable tool for exploring and discovering response regimes in complex dynamical systems, especially when the governing equations and the number of response regimes are unknown, and the system is expensive to sample. Additionally, the method is useful for order reduction, as it can be used to identify the most dominant response regimes of a given dynamical system. DR\${\textasciicircum}2\$EI utilizes unsupervised learning algorithms to transform the system's response into an embedding space that facilitates regime classification. An active sequential sampling approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is used to efficiently sample the parameter space, quantify uncertainty, and provide optimal trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. The performance of the DR\${\textasciicircum}2\$EI method was evaluated by analyzing three established dynamical systems: the mathematical pendulum, the Lorenz system, and the Duffing oscillator. The method was shown to effectively identify a variety of response regimes with both similar and distinct topological features and frequency content, demonstrating its versatility in capturing a wide range of behaviors. While it may not be possible to guarantee that all possible regimes will be identified, the method provides an automated and efficient means for exploring the parameter space of a dynamical system and identifying its underlying "sufficiently dominant" response regimes without prior knowledge of the system's equations or behavior.},

This model includes an approximation of the evolution of a nonlinear augmented state as a linear combination of the state and augmented state. When the evolution of the nonlinear augmented state is not captured exactly by the Koopman model, control action designed against the Koopman model can fail. We present two control solutions to address this problem. The first is to account for the error in the Koopman model directly. We design a sliding mode controller to do this. The second is to change the Koopman model and an adaptive controller’s parameters in tandem to ensure asymptotic stability of the origin of the closed-loop system. This may mean that the Koopman model itself is less accurate, however, the controlled system is guaranteed to be stable. This result implies that certain scenarios merit datadriven control strategies distinct from system identification strategies that prioritize best fit.},

Our approach relies on the Koopman operator, which is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator lifting the nonlinear system to a higher-dimensional space. Particularly, we derive a linear fractional representation of a lifted bilinear system representation based on measured data. Further, we restrict the lifting to finite dimensions, but account for the truncation error using a finite-gain argument. We derive a linear matrix inequality based design procedure to guarantee robust local stability for the resulting bilinear system for all error terms satisfying the finite-gain bound and, thus, also for the underlying nonlinear system. Finally, we apply the developed design method to the nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator.},

An ideal set of kernels should: admit a linear parameterization (for tractability); be dense in the set of all kernels (for robustness); be universal (for accuracy). Recently, a framework was proposed for using positive matrices to parameterize a class of positive semi-separable kernels. Although this class can be shown to meet all three criteria, previous algorithms for optimization of such kernels were limited to classification and furthermore relied on computationally complex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) algorithms. In this paper, we pose the problem of learning semiseparable kernels as a minimax optimization problem and propose a SVD-QCQP primal-dual algorithm which dramatically reduces the computational complexity as compared with previous SDP-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation of this algorithm for both classification and regression -- an implementation which enables us to solve problems with 100 features and up to 30,000 datums. Finally, when applied to benchmark data, the algorithm demonstrates the potential for significant improvement in accuracy over typical (but non-convex) approaches such as Neural Nets and Random Forest with similar or better computation time.},

On this basis, a variant of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is developed. First, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is integrated to enforce model selection by hierarchically ranking the most informative model from several manageable candidate models. This integration avoids restricting the number of candidate models, which is a disadvantage of the traditional methods for model selection. The subsequent procedure expands the structure of dynamics from ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to partial differential equations (PDEs), while group sparsity is employed to identify the nonconstant coefficients of partial differential equations. Of practical consideration within an integrated frame is data processing, which tends to treat noise separate from signals and tends to parametrize the noise probability distribution. In particular, the coefficients of a species of canonical ODEs and PDEs, such as the Van der Pol, Rössler, Burgers’ and Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equations, can be identified correctly with the introduction of noise. Furthermore, except for normal noise, the proposed approach is able to capture the distribution of uniform noise.

	abstract = {Highly accurate simulations of complex phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) typically require intrusive methods and entail expensive computational costs, which might become prohibitive when approximating steady-state solutions of PDEs for multiple combinations of control parameters and initial conditions. Therefore, constructing efficient reduced order models (ROMs) that enable accurate but fast predictions, while retaining the dynamical characteristics of the physical phenomenon as parameters vary, is of paramount importance. In this work, a data-driven, non-intrusive framework which combines ROM construction with reduced dynamics identification, is presented. Starting from a limited amount of full order solutions, the proposed approach leverages autoencoder neural networks with parametric sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to construct a low-dimensional dynamical model. This model can be queried to efficiently compute full-time solutions at new parameter instances, as well as directly fed to continuation algorithms. These aim at tracking the evolution of periodic steady-state responses as functions of system parameters, avoiding the computation of the transient phase, and allowing to detect instabilities and bifurcations. Featuring an explicit and parametrized modeling of the reduced dynamics, the proposed data-driven framework presents remarkable capabilities to generalize with respect to both time and parameters.

	abstract = {A novel hyper-reduction method is proposed that conserves kinetic energy and momentum for reduced order models of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The main advantage of conservation of kinetic energy is that it endows the hyper-reduced order model (hROM) with a nonlinear stability property. The new method poses the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) as a minimization problem and subsequently imposes constraints to conserve kinetic energy. Two methods are proposed to improve the robustness of the new method against error accumulation: oversampling and Mahalanobis regularization. Mahalanobis regularization has the benefit of not requiring additional measurement points. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to perform structure-preserving temporal localization with the principle interval decomposition: new interface conditions are derived such that energy and momentum are conserved for a full time-integration instead of only during separate intervals. The performance of the new structure-preserving hyper-reduction methods and the structure-preserving temporal localization method is analysed using two convection-dominated test cases; a shear-layer roll-up and two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. It is found that both Mahalanobis regularization and oversampling allow hyper-reduction of these test cases. Moreover, the Mahalanobis regularization provides comparable robustness while being more efficient than oversampling.},

	abstract = {Balanced Singular Perturbation Approximation (SPA) is a model order reduction method for linear time-invariant systems that guarantees asymptotic stability and for which there exists an a priori error bound. In that respect, it is similar to Balanced Truncation (BT). However, the reduced models obtained by SPA generally introduce better approximation in the lower frequency range and near steady-states, whereas BT is better suited for the higher frequency range. Even so, independently of the frequency range of interest, BT and its variants are more often applied in practice, since there exist more efficient algorithmic realizations thereof. In this paper, we aim at closing this practically-relevant gap for SPA. We propose two novel and efficient algorithms that are adapted for different settings. Firstly, we derive a low-rank implementation of SPA that is applicable in the large-scale setting. Secondly, a data-driven reinterpretation of the method is proposed that only requires input-output data, and thus, is realization-free. A main tool for our derivations is the reciprocal transformation, which induces a distinct view on implementing the method. While the reciprocal transformation and the characterization of SPA is not new, its significance for the practical algorithmic realization has been overlooked in the literature. Our proposed algorithms have well-established counterparts for BT, and as such, also a comparable computational complexity. The numerical performance of the two novel implementations is tested for several numerical benchmarks, and comparisons to their counterparts for BT as well as the existing implementations of SPA are made.},

The resulting models, hereafter referred to as Galerkin regression models, incorporate many beneficial aspects of Galerkin projection, but without the need for a high-fidelity solver to project the Navier–Stokes equations. Instead, the most parsimonious nonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed measurement data and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also readily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the effect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of such an approach is demonstrated on two canonical flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow. For both cases, the accuracy of the identified models compare favourably against reduced-order models obtained from a standard Galerkin projection procedure. Finally, the entire code base for our constrained sparse Galerkin regression algorithm is freely available online.},

	abstract = {Rapid prediction of the aeroacoustic response is a key component in the design of aircraft and turbomachinery. While it is possible to achieve accurate predictions using direct solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, applications of such solvers is not feasible in design optimization due to the high cost of resolving wave phenomena in an Eulerian setting. In this work, we propose a technique for highly accelerated predictions of aeroacoustic response using a data-driven model reduction approach based on the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), as a non-intrusive balanced truncation method. Specifically, we create and compare ERA ROMs based on the training data generated by solving the linearized and nonlinear Euler equations with Gaussian pulse inputs, and use them for prediction of the aeroacoustic response of an airfoil subject to different types of gust loading. The results show that both ROMs are in good agreement with the full-order model (FOM) solution in a purely predictive setting, while achieving orders of magnitude reduction in the online computation time. Using ERA for prediction of the acoustic response requires activating each input channel separately in the FOM for training ROMs, and operating on a large Hankel matrix, that can become computationally infeasible. We address this bottleneck in two steps: first, we propose a multi-fidelity gappy POD method to identify the most impactful input channels based on a coarser grid. Therefore, we reduce the computation cost on the FOM and ROM levels as we build the Markov sequence by querying the high-resolution FOM only for the input channels identified by gappy POD. Second, we use tangential interpolation at the ROM level to reduce the size of the Hankel matrix. The proposed methods enable application of ERA for highly accurate online acoustic response prediction and reduce the offline computation cost of ROMs.},

	abstract = {Generally, reduced order models of fluid flows are obtained by projecting the Navier-Stokes equations onto a reduced subspace spanned by vector functions that carry the meaningful information of the dynamics. A common method to generate such subspace is the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. This projection strategy is intrusive since it assumes that the approximation model used to solve the high fidelity flow problem is known and accessible. In the present article, we propose a non-intrusive paradigm based on Machine Learning to build Closed Parametric Reduced Order Models (ML-PROM) relevant to fluid dynamics. With no prior knowledge requirement of the approximation model, this method is purely data-driven as it operates directly on data regardless their origin, DNS, RANS simulations or experiment. The key idea to build the ML-CPROM is to use the generally known form of Galerkin ROMs and assimilate the time variations of the temporal POD modes to a nonlinear quadratic form taking a closure right hand side member. This last term is introduced to account for uncaptured dynamics due to data noise, POD truncation errors and time integration schemes. For parameter variation, the ML-CPROM is updated by interpolation on the quotient manifold of the set of fixed rank matrices by the orthogonal group. The predicted closure term is afterwards calculated by a Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network. We assess the potential of the proposed approach on the parametric examples of the lid-driven cavity flow and the flow past a cylinder by varying the Reynolds number through the viscosity, and the Ahmed-Body flow by varying the geometry through the rear slant angle. We show on these examples that our method enables to recover the dynamics with a good accuracy, not only for the training parameter points, but also for unseen parameter values for which the model was not priory trained.},

Reduced-order models based on Galerkin projection of the governing equations onto an orthogonal modal basis approximate the flow as a low-dimensional dynamical system with linear and quadratic terms. However, these Galerkin models often fail to reproduce the true dynamics, in part because they ignore important nonlinear interactions with unresolved flow scales. Here, we use a separation of time scales between the resolved and subscale variables to derive a reduced-order model with cubic closure terms for the truncated modes, generalizing the classic Stuart-Landau equation. The leading order cubic terms are determined by averaging out fast variables through a perturbation series approximation of the action of a stochastic Koopman operator. We show analytically that this multiscale closure model can capture both the effects of mean-flow deformation and the energy cascade before demonstrating improved stability and accuracy in models of chaotic lid-driven cavity flow and vortex pairing in a mixing layer. This approach to closure modeling establishes a general theory for the origin and role of cubic nonlinearities in low-dimensional models of incompressible flows},

Traditional equations-based approaches leverage first principles to yield predictions through the numerical approximation of high-dimensional systems of differential equations, thus calling for large-scale parallel computing platforms and requiring large computational costs. Data-driven approaches, instead, enable the description of systems evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, by leveraging dimensionality reduction and deep learning algorithms. We propose a novel architecture, named Latent Dynamics Network (LDNet), which is able to discover low-dimensional intrinsic dynamics of possibly non-Markovian dynamical systems, thus predicting the time evolution of space-dependent fields in response to external inputs. Unlike popular approaches, in which the latent representation of the solution manifold is learned by means of auto-encoders that map a high-dimensional discretization of the system state into itself, LDNets automatically discover a low-dimensional manifold while learning the latent dynamics, without ever operating in the high-dimensional space. Furthermore, LDNets are meshless algorithms that do not reconstruct the output on a predetermined grid of points, but rather at any point of the domain, thus enabling weight-sharing across query-points. These features make LDNets lightweight and easy-to-train, with excellent accuracy and generalization properties, even in time-extrapolation regimes. We validate our method on several test cases and we show that, for a challenging highly-nonlinear problem, LDNets outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy (normalized error 5 times smaller), by employing a dramatically smaller number of trainable parameters (more than 10 times fewer).},

The present work introduces an autoencoder framework that combines implicit regularization with internal linear layers and \$L\_2\$ regularization (weight decay) to automatically estimate the underlying dimensionality of a data set, produce an orthogonal manifold coordinate system, and provide the mapping functions between the ambient space and manifold space, allowing for out-of-sample projections. We validate our framework's ability to estimate the manifold dimension for a series of datasets from dynamical systems of varying complexities and compare to other state-of-the-art estimators. We analyze the training dynamics of the network to glean insight into the mechanism of low-rank learning and find that collectively each of the implicit regularizing layers compound the low-rank representation and even self-correct during training. Analysis of gradient descent dynamics for this architecture in the linear case reveals the role of the internal linear layers in leading to faster decay of a "collective weight variable" incorporating all layers, and the role of weight decay in breaking degeneracies and thus driving convergence along directions in which no decay would occur in its absence. We show that this framework can be naturally extended for applications of state-space modeling and forecasting by generating a data-driven dynamic model of a spatiotemporally chaotic partial differential equation using only the manifold coordinates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework is robust to hyperparameter choices.},

The tremendous increase in the speed of scientific computing has also made it possible to emulate diverse high-dimensional, multiscale and multiphysics phenomena that contain elements of stochasticity, and to generate large volumes of numerical data for them in heterogeneous systems. The difficulty is, however, that often the governing equations for such phenomena are not known. A prime example is flow, transport, and deformation processes in macroscopically-heterogeneous materials and geomedia. In other cases, the governing equations are only partially known, in the sense that they either contain various coefficients that must be evaluated based on data, or that they require constitutive relations, such as the relationship between the stress tensor and the velocity gradients for non-Newtonian fluids in the momentum conservation equation, in order for them to be useful to the modeling. Several classes of approaches are emerging to address such problems that are based on machine learning, symbolic regression, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formulation, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, data assimilation, and stochastic optimization and analysis, or a combination of two or more of such approaches.

	abstract = {In fluid dynamics, predicting and characterizing bifurcations, from the onset of unsteadiness to the transition to turbulence, is of critical importance for both academic and industrial applications. Different tools from dynamical systems theory can be used for this purpose. In this review, we present a concise theoretical and numerical framework focusing on practical aspects of the computation and stability analyses of steady and time-periodic solutions, with emphasis on high-dimensional systems such as those arising from the spatial discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations. Using a matrix-free approach based on Krylov methods, we extend the capabilities of the open-source high-performance spectral element-based time-stepper Nek5000. The numerical methods discussed are implemented in nekStab, an open-source and user-friendly add-on toolbox dedicated to the study of stability properties of flows in complex three-dimensional geometries. The performance and accuracy of the methods are illustrated and examined using standard benchmarks from the fluid mechanics literature. Thanks to its flexibility and domain-agnostic nature, the methodology presented in this work can be applied to develop similar toolboxes for other solvers, most importantly outside the field of fluid mechanics.},

Our experiments aim at providing a comparison to global linear stability theory (LST) by means of hot-film anemometry and particle image velocimetry. Although the critical Reynolds number from theory does not match the transition Reynolds number observed in experiments, there are distinct experimental observations indicating a changeover from purely convective to absolute/global instability very close to the critical Reynolds number predicted by theory. Forcing with a vibrating wire reveals the evolution of the system dynamics from an amplifier to a wavemaker when the critical Reynolds number is exceeded. The mode symmetry is varicose for thick roughness elements and a changeover from varicose to sinuous modes is observed at the critical Reynolds number for thin roughness elements. Therefore, most predictions by global LST can be confirmed, but additional observations in the physical flow demonstrate that not all features can be captured adequately by global LST.},

We develop machine learning methods to reconstruct flow features from sparse sensor measurements during transient vortex-airfoil wake interaction using only a limited amount of training data. The present machine learning models accurately reconstruct the aerodynamic force coefficients, pressure distributions over airfoil surface, and two-dimensional vorticity field for a variety of untrained cases. Multi-layer perceptron is used for estimating aerodynamic forces and pressure profiles over the surface, establishing a nonlinear model between the pressure sensor measurements and the output variables. A combination of multi-layer perceptron with convolutional neural network is utilized to reconstruct the vortical wake. Furthermore, the use of transfer learning and long short-term memory algorithm combined in the training models greatly improves the reconstruction of transient wakes by embedding the dynamics. The present machine-learning methods are able to estimate the transient flow features while exhibiting robustness against noisy sensor measurements. Finally, appropriate sensor locations over different time periods are assessed for accurately estimating the wakes. The present study offers insights into the dynamics of vortex-airfoil interaction and the development of data-driven flow estimation.},

This is in contrast to previous algorithms, which are designed to provide tight approximation guarantees in one setting, but not both. We also improve the analysis of RepeatedGreedy, showing that it achieves an approximation ratio of \$k + {\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})\$ for \$k\$-systems when allowed to run for \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})\$ iterations, an improvement in both the runtime and approximation over previous analyses. We demonstrate that both algorithms may be modified to run in nearly linear time with an arbitrarily small loss in the approximation. Both SimultaneousGreedys and RepeatedGreedy are flexible enough to incorporate the intersection of \$m\$ additional knapsack constraints, while retaining similar approximation guarantees: both algorithms yield an approximation guarantee of roughly \$k + 2m + {\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{k+m\})\$ for \$k\$-systems and SimultaneousGreedys enjoys an improved approximation guarantee of \$k+2m + {\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{m\})\$ for \$k\$-extendible systems. To complement our algorithmic contributions, we provide a hardness result which states that no algorithm making polynomially many oracle queries can achieve an approximation better than \$k + 1/2 + {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$.

In this paper, we show that once the function is expressed as the difference \$f = g - c\$, where \$g\$ is monotone, non-negative, and \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-weakly submodular and \$c\$ is non-negative modular, then strong approximation guarantees may be obtained.

We extend these results to the unconstrained setting by describing an algorithm with the same approximation guarantees and faster \$O({\textbackslash}frac\{n\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} {\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$ runtime. The main techniques underlying our algorithms are two-fold: the use of a surrogate objective which varies the relative importance between \$g\$ and \$c\$ throughout the algorithm, and a geometric sweep over possible \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ values. Our algorithmic guarantees are complemented by a hardness result showing that no polynomial-time algorithm which accesses \$g\$ through a value oracle can do better. We empirically demonstrate the success of our algorithms by applying them to experimental design on the Boston Housing dataset and directed vertex cover on the Email EU dataset.},

In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})\$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to \$k\$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves \$(1 + O(1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\}))k\$ approximation using \$O(nr{\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})\$ function evaluations (here, \$n\$ and \$r\$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to \$k\$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of \$k\$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves \$(k + 3)\$-approximation with only \$O(nr/k)\$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than \$ k + 1/2 - {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.},

In many applications, we have limited access to the information of the whole system, which motivates non-intrusive model reduction. One bottleneck is capturing the dynamics of the solution without knowing the physics inside the ``black-box'' system. DMD is a powerful tool to mimic the dynamics of the system and give a reliable approximation of the solution in the time domain using only the dominant DMD modes. However, DMD cannot reproduce the parametric behavior of the dynamics. Our contribution focuses on extending DMD to parametric DMD by RBF interpolation. Specifically, an RBF network is first trained using snapshot matrices at limited parameter samples. The snapshot matrix at any new parameter sample can be quickly learned from the RBF network. DMD will use the newly generated snapshot matrix at the online stage to predict the time patterns of the dynamics corresponding to the new parameter sample. The proposed framework and algorithm are tested and validated by numerical examples including models with parametrized and time-varying inputs.},

It enables a low-redundant adaptive extraction of coherent structures in statistically nonstationary flows, with its modes computed by solving an elaborate optimization problem using the block coordinate descent algorithm. Discussion on the intrinsic relations between RVMD and some classic modal decomposition methods demonstrates that RVMD can be reduced into proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) at particular parameter settings. The significant advantages of RVMD for performing time-frequency analysis are highlighted by a signal-processing analogous categorization of the widely-used modal decomposition techniques. It is also confirmed that the combination of RVMD and the Hilbert spectral analysis provides a physically intuitive way to explore the space-time-frequency characteristics of transient dynamics. Finally, all the appealing features of RVMD mentioned above are well verified via two canonical flow problems: the transient cylinder wake and the rectangular turbulent supersonic screeching jet.},

At the heart of this method are optimization schemes that enforce interpolation of the symmetric generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) as derived in the Volterra series framework. We consider harmonic input excitations to infer such measurements. After reaching the steady-state profile, the symmetric GFRFs can be measured from the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude). By properly using these measurements, we can identify low-order nonlinear state-space models with non-trivial equilibrium state points in the quadratic form, such as the Lorenz attractor. In particular, for the multi-point equilibrium case, where measurements describe some local bifurcated models to different coordinates, we achieve global model identification after solving an operator alignment problem based on a constrained quadratic matrix equation. We test the new method for a more demanding system in terms of state dimension, i.e., the viscous Burgers' equation with Robin boundary conditions. The complexity reduction and approximation accuracy are tested. Future directions and challenges conclude this work.},

Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims instead to infer causally related (thus often statistically dependent) latent variables, together with the unknown graph encoding their causal relationships.

CauCA can be viewed as a generalization of ICA, modelling the causal dependence among the latent components, and as a special case of CRL. In contrast to CRL, it presupposes knowledge of the causal graph, focusing solely on learning the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms. Any impossibility results regarding the recovery of the ground truth in CauCA also apply for CRL, while possibility results may serve as a stepping stone for extensions to CRL. We characterize CauCA identifiability from multiple datasets generated through different types of interventions on the latent causal variables. As a corollary, this interventional perspective also leads to new identifiability results for nonlinear ICA -- a special case of CauCA with an empty graph -- requiring strictly fewer datasets than previous results. We introduce a likelihood-based approach using normalizing flows to estimate both the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive synthetic experiments in the CauCA and ICA setting.},

	abstract = {Reduced order modelling relies on representing complex dynamical systems using simplified modes, which can be achieved through Koopman operator analysis. However, computing Koopman eigen pairs for high-dimensional observable data can be inefficient. This paper proposes using deep autoencoders, a type of deep learning technique, to perform non-linear geometric transformations on raw data before computing Koopman eigen vectors. The encoded data produced by the deep autoencoder is diffeomorphic to a manifold of the dynamical system, and has a significantly lower dimension than the raw data. To handle high-dimensional time series data, Takens's time delay embedding is presented as a pre-processing technique. The paper concludes by presenting examples of these techniques in action.},

	abstract = {It has become common to perform kinetic analysis using approximate Koopman operators that transforms high-dimensional time series of observables into ranked dynamical modes. Key to a practical success of the approach is the identification of a set of observables which form a good basis in which to expand the slow relaxation modes. Good observables are, however, difficult to identify \{{\textbackslash}em a priori\} and sub-optimal choices can lead to significant underestimations of characteristic timescales. Leveraging the representation of slow dynamics in terms of Hidden Markov Model (HMM), we propose a simple and computationally efficient clustering procedure to infer surrogate observables that form a good basis for slow modes. We apply the approach to an analytically solvable model system, as well as on three protein systems of different complexities. We consistently demonstrate that the inferred indicator functions can significantly improve the estimation of the leading eigenvalues of the Koopman operators and correctly identify key states and transition timescales of stochastic systems, even when good observables are not known \{{\textbackslash}em a priori\}.},

	abstract = {Automated model selection is an important application in science and engineering. In this work, we develop a learning approach for identifying structured dynamical systems from undersampled and noisy spatiotemporal data. The learning is performed by a sparse least-squares fitting over a large set of candidate functions via a nonconvex \${\textbackslash}ell\_1-{\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ sparse optimization solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers. Using a Bernstein-like inequality with a coherence condition, we show that if the set of candidate functions forms a structured random sampling matrix of a bounded orthogonal system, the recovery is stable and the error is bounded. The learning approach is validated on synthetic data generated by the viscous Burgers' equation and two reaction-diffusion equations. The computational results demonstrate the theoretical guarantees of success and the efficiency with respect to the ambient dimension and the number of candidate functions.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2306.01065},
	abstract = {Experimental measurements and numerical simulations of turbulent flows are characterised by a trade-off between accuracy and resolution. In this study, we bridge this gap using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) constrained by the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and accurate sparse pointwise mean velocity measurements for data assimilation (DA). Firstly, by constraining the PINN with sparse data and the under-determined RANS equations without closure, we show that the mean flow is reconstructed to a higher accuracy than a RANS solver using the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model. Secondly, we propose the SA turbulence model augmented PINN (PINN-DA-SA), which outperforms the former approach - up to 73\% reduction in mean velocity reconstruction error with coarse measurements. The additional SA physics constraints improve flow reconstructions in regions with high velocity and pressure gradients and separation. Thirdly, we compare the PINN-DA-SA approach to a variational data assimilation using the same sparse velocity measurements and physics constraints. The PINN-DA-SA achieves lower reconstruction error across a range of data resolutions. This is attributed to discretisation errors in the variational methodology that are avoided by PINNs. We demonstrate the method using high fidelity measurements from direct numerical simulation of the turbulent periodic hill at Re=5600.},

	abstract = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been widely used in fluid dynamic applications for extracting dominant flow features. The “gappy” POD is an extension to this method that allows the consideration of incomplete data sets. In this paper, the gappy POD is extended to handle unsteady flow reconstruction problems, such as those encountered when limited flow measurement data is available. In addition, a systematic approach for effective sensor placement is formulated within the gappy framework using a condition number criterion. This criterion allows for accurate flow reconstruction results and yields sensor configurations that are robust to sensor noise. Two applications are considered. The first aims to reconstruct the unsteady flow field using a small number of surface pressure measurements for a subsonic airfoil undergoing plunging motion. The second considers estimation of POD modal content of a cylinder wake flow for active control purposes. In both cases, using the dominant POD basis vectors and a small number of sensor signals, the gappy approach is found to yield accurate flow reconstruction results.},

Many optimal actuator problems involve systems modelled by partial differential equations and conditions under which approximations yield reliable results are given.

	abstract = {This paper is motivated by sensor location problems for infinite dimensional linear distributed parameter systems (DPS) defined by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this setting the term “sensor location” usually refers to a spatial location. However, the problem is also meaningful in finite dimensional models and results in a parameterization of the system output matrix. The problem of “optimal” sensor (and actuator) location has a long history and plays an important role in controller design, system identification and state estimation and, depending on the application, can be formulated in many ways. Any optimal location problem implies that there is a cost function to be minimized and the choice of this cost function places specific requirements on the computational methods needed to solve the problem. In addition, as shown in the papers Yang and Morris [2014, 2015] choices such as “optimizing observability” can lead to ill-posed problems and result in non convergence of suboptimal placements. On the other hand, minimum error variance methods (Kalman filtering) can be shown be well-posed. Efficient computational methods for solving the corresponding Riccati partial differential equation have been developed and are readily available. In the classic paper by Luenberger [1964], he introduced the term “observer” for deterministic state estimation to distinguish it from the Kalman filter. In this paper we focus on state estimators based on the Luenberger observer and suggest some natural cost functions for sensor location. The framework is fairly general and applies to both finite and infinite dimensional systems. Examples are given to illustrate the ideas.},

By implementing actuators and sensors and designing an H2 optimal controller, we control a supercritical, infinite-domain formulation of this system. We seek the optimal actuator and sensor placement that minimises the H2 norm of the controlled system, from flow disturbances and sensor noise to a cost on the perturbation and input magnitudes. We formulate the gradient of the H2 squared norm with respect to the actuator and sensor placements and iterate towards the optimal placement. When stochastic flow disturbances are present everywhere in the spatial domain, it is optimal to place the actuator just upstream of the origin and the sensor just downstream. With pairs of actuators and sensors, it is optimal to place each actuator slightly upstream of each corresponding sensor, and scatter the pairs throughout the spatial domain. When disturbances are only introduced upstream, the optimal placement shifts upstream as well. Global mode and Gramian analyses fail to predict the optimal placement; they produce H2 norms about five times higher than at the true optimum. The wavemaker region is a better guess for the optimal placement.},
